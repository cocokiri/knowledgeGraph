When I call someone directly whom I haven’t spoken with before, I try to call at an unusual time. Someone who is busy is more likely to pick up their own phone at 8:00 A.M. or 6:30 P.M. Plus, they’re probably less stressed out since they’re not facing typical nine-to-five pressures. I called in the early morning, but got Serge’s voice mail. So I left a message: “I just want to reiterate my excitement regarding our meeting. I’ve never heard John talk so flatteringly of a business associate. I understand how busy you must be. I haven’t heard from your administrative assistant, but I’m sure I will. See you soon.” At no point do you want your interactions to become strained. Creating and maintaining a sense of optimism and gentle pressure around the appointment is all part of the dance. In fifteen seconds, I used my four rules for what I call warm calling: 1) Convey credibility by mentioning a familiar person or institution - in this case, John, Jeff, and WebMD. 2) State your value proposition: Jeff’s new product would help Serge sell his new products. 3) Impart urgency and convenience by being prepared to do whatever it takes whenever it takes to meet the other person on his or her own terms. 4) Be prepared to offer a compromise that secures a definite follow-up at a minimum. That was Ken’s five-minute sales pitch. It was 98 percent value-add for me, 2 percent sales pitch by him. Invisibility is a fate far worse than failure. In building a network, remember: Above all, never, ever disappear. Keep your social and conference and event calendar full. As an up-and-comer, you must work hard to remain visible and active among your ever-budding network of friends and contacts.

Deep bumps are an effort to quickly make contact, establish enough of a connection to secure the next meeting, and move on. Creating a connection between any two people necessitates a certain level of intimacy. In two minutes, you need to look deeply into the other person’s eyes and heart, listen intently, ask questions that go beyond just business, and reveal a little about yourself in a way that introduces some vulnerability (yes, vulnerability; it’s contagious!) into the interaction. All these things come together to create a genuine connection.

neutrality! Who can thus avoid all pledges and, having observed, observe again from the same unaffected, unbiased, unbribable, unaffrighted innocence,—must always be formidable. He would utter opinions on all passing affairs, which being seen to be not private but necessary, would sink like darts into the ear of men and put them in fear.  These are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world. Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members. Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs.  Whoso would be a man, must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world.

Rarely has an author been called upon to explicate his book so frequently, in the face of hostile attitudes towards a text based upon not reading it, reading a few bits of it, misreading it or reading it through the transforming lens of assumptions about religion. The day passes to the sound of the powerful explaining away their mistakes, distortions and lies. "Reality instructors", to use Saul Bellow's term, are all around; reality instruction may be the biggest growth industry of our time. The bookstores are filled with non-fiction because we are losing faith in our dreams and believe that only the facts can tell the truth, but the most popular books of all are still fictions filled with the purest drivel. In our private lives we pay fortunes to sit in rooms with wiser men and women, seeking explanations for our weaknesses, our inner turbulence, our grief. We pay nobody, however, to help us understand our joys. These we can readily explain; or, rather, happiness needs no explanation. It is misery that demands a confessor.

However—for such is the nature of the publishing industry—at the very moment when the author wishes to be invisible, he is required to be most visible. Every writer comes to dread the sound of his own voice repeating answers over and over again. The effect, if the process goes on long enough (and it does, it does), is to alienate one from one's own work.Publication comes to seem like the process by which the author is persuaded to detest his book, so that he has to begin writing another story to obliterate the one he can no longer bear to discuss.

once saw Joseph Heller being interviewed about, if memory serves, his novel Good as Gold, and refusing, in spite of much coaxing by the interviewer, to talk about his book in any terms except those of his characters: what they felt, what they wanted, what they were like, why they acted as they did. He simply refused to step back from his art and pontificate about it "from the outside". How wise he was! Why can't I do that? To my mind, the best argument in favour of the principle of the universality of free speech is not an appeal to its rationality, but to its place at the heart of human nature. We are, as I've often said, storytelling animals, the only creatures on our planet, as far as we know, that use story—narrative, history, gossip, philosophy—as a way of understanding ourselves. Any external limitations on our ability to speak, or on the content of our speech, therefore interferes with something essential to us all, whether we are writers or not. When people are told that they cannot freely re-examine the stories of themselves, and the stories within which they live, then tyranny is not very far away.

He believed (at least while he was young) that this uncertainty and indeterminacy at the subatomic level permitted humans to exercise free will—a trait that, if it existed, would seem to distinguish them from machines.

When the human player of the Turing test uses words, he associates those words with real-world meanings, emotions, experiences, sensations and perceptions. Machines don’t. Without such connections, language is just a game divorced from meaning. This critique of the Turing test remains the most debated topic in cognitive science.

Turing at first seemed to take it all in stride, but on June 7, 1954, at age 41, he committed suicide by biting into an apple he had laced with cyanide. He had always been fascinated by the scene in Snow White in which the Wicked Queen dips an apple into a poisonous brew. He was found in his bed with froth around his mouth, cyanide in his system and a half-eaten apple by his side. The imitation game was over. He was human.

Don’t confuse creativity and imagination with “thinking” either. Ray Bradbury said that thinking is the enemy of creativity because it’s self-conscious. When you think you sit calmly and try to reason through something in a structured, logical way. Creativity dances to a different tune. Once you flip that switch, things get a bit chaotic. Ideas start buzzing. Images start popping into your head. Fragments of all kinds of data find their way into orbit. We’re pulled in one direction, then suddenly our instincts send us flying in another. Material collides and fuses, disappears and reappears. This chaos is essential to the creative process. A breakthrough occurs when pieces happen to come together in unique and harmonic ways.

Williams began his path to greatness at the age of seven, when he decided to dedicate his entire life to one singular task: hitting a baseball as perfectly as possible. Starting at that young age, Williams spent every free minute he had at San Diego’s old North Park field hitting balls, every day, year after year after year. His childhood friends recall finding him on that field smashing balls with the outer shells completely beaten off, with a splintered bat, and with blistered, bleeding hands. He would spend his lunch money to hire other kids to shag his balls so he could hit as many as possible every day. When the city turned off the field’s lights, he would go home and swing a rolled-up newspaper in the mirror until he went to bed.

Most sports enforce age cut-offs—that is, the ages that determine whether you can play another year in your current age bracket as a “senior,” or whether you have to move up and be a “freshman” in the next. In Canadian junior hockey leagues, the age cutoff was formally January 1 (it’s now December 31). The closer your birthday was to January 2, the better. Why? Well, let’s say you were playing in the Bantam category, which is for children aged 13 – 14. If your birthday was in December, you were going to get two years of play at this level. You were going to turn fifteen and have to move immediately into the next category, Midget (which is for kids aged 15 – 16). If your birthday was January 2, however, you’d get an entire additional year to play in Bantam (and every other age group) because when the ages were checked on January 1, you were still fourteen years old. An extra year of play against players younger than you is a huge advantage. Your body becomes bigger, stronger, and faster every day, giving you an opportunity to truly stand out from your birthday-handicapped peers. This extra developmental time predisposes you for selection onto more elite teams, which in turn leads to more ice time and better coaching, which advances your abilities even further.

He first noted and categorized a long list of factors outside of the geniuses’ control. Things like lineage, birthright, geography, genetics, education, familial ties, upbringing, and unexpected windfalls. The more data he accumulated and analyzed along this line, however, the more it looked like a dead end. The backgrounds of our species’ greatest thinkers and achievers appeared infinitely varied. If there were patterns among the data, he couldn’t see them. Barrios was undeterred and continued to study. Eventually, a different kind of common denominator emerged, one that he found within each of the people he studied. Barrios discovered that his subjects had each developed and routinely displayed a combination of very specific characteristics throughout their lives, and not just mildly but conspicuously. This character-driven idea fascinated Barrios. It suggested that genius is much more than high intelligence, innate talent, extraordinary work ethic, or uncanny luck, but rather a composite manifestation; a synthesis of very specific types of worldviews and behaviors.

Tesla was admiring the prismatic rays of the Hungarian sunset when a vision struck him. Following a blinding flash of light, he saw the complete workings of a motor that used a rotating magnetic field to produce an electric current that alternated its direction many times per second. He grabbed a stick and diagrammed the motor in the sand while his friend watched, unsure of what to think. After all, such a machine was theoretically impossible. In fact, seven years earlier, his professor at a college in Austria ridiculed him for suggesting that direct current generators could be modified to produce an efficient alternating current. Tesla dropped out of college a year later, but his imagination never quit. Shortly after his Varosliget park revelation, Tesla took the first step to make it a reality: he relocated to Paris to work for the Continental Edison Company installing lighting systems in commercial properties.

In 1885, Tesla informed Edison that he could greatly improve his direct current generators by redesigning key elements. Edison thought it impossible and promised Tesla $50,000 if he could deliver on his claims. Tesla worked tirelessly for the better part of a year to improve the generators, installing parts of his own design. Once completed, his generators were a vast improvement over Edison’s. They were far more efficient and durable, and thus far more profitable. Edison was thoroughly impressed, but when Tesla asked to be paid, Edison laughed and claimed he was only joking about the reward. “Tesla, you don’t understand our American humor,” he said. Instead, Edison offered Tesla a raise of $10 more per week, to be added to his current salary of $18 per week. Tesla was disgusted and immediately resigned. This was the beginning of a lifelong feud between these two great inventors—one that Edison would later lament as his “greatest mistake.” Betrayed by men he trusted, Tesla found himself unemployed and in desperate need of work to survive. Ironically, he took a job as a ditch digger for an Edison company, and was paid $2 per day. He described this time as one of “terrible headaches and bitter tears,” a dark period so grim that he began to question the value of his education and knowledge. But despite his heartbreak, he continued to expand on his designs for an alternating current system of generators, motors, and transformers, but lacked the money to build prototypes and apply for patents.

“The motors I built there,” Tesla later said, “were exactly as I imagined them. I made no attempt to improve the design, but merely reproduced the pictures as they appeared to my vision and the operation was always as expected.” In November 1887, Tesla filed for seven U.S. Patents for his inventions, which were so original that they were issued without challenge. These patents comprised a complete system of generators, transformers, transmission lines, motors, and lighting. They would become the most valuable patents since the telephone. In accordance with their agreement, Tesla split the ownership of the patents on a fifty-fifty basis with his investors.

Edison and Morgan launched a full-scale propaganda assault against alternating current. Edison knew that direct current would have to stamp out alternating current to survive. More personally, he was heavily invested both financially and emotionally in his direct current network of generators and distribution lines. Edison declared publicly that alternating current delivered to a home would kill a customer within six months. Leaflets about the dangers of alternating current were distributed. Lobbying efforts were made in New York to limit levels of electricity to 800 volts “as a matter of public safety,” which would conveniently make long-distance alternating current transmission impossible. Edison’s efforts then took a turn for the grisly. He began holding weekend demonstrations of the hazards of Tesla’s work by electrocuting animals found roaming the streets. He directed two technicians to do the same, including the execution of cattle and horses. The morbid campaign climaxed in 1890 with Edison’s involvement in the use of a Westinghouse generator to execute a convicted ax-murderer. The voltage to kill had been misjudged, leaving the criminal badly injured, and the process had to be repeated. A journalist described the event as an “awful spectacle, far worse than hanging.” The torturous method of execution was dubbed “Westinghousing,” and Morgan and Edison tried to popularize the term in the media. Disgusted by Edison’s shameless cruelty and dishonesty, Tesla began performing regular exhibitions of his technology in his laboratory in which he lighted lamps by allowing alternating current electricity to flow through his body. Public opinion swung to and fro, unsure of whom to believe. In this we can see the necessity of being willing to fight for your creations. Morgan and Edison weren’t satisfied with trying to ruin Tesla through capitalistic competition—they were resorting to outright depravity and dishonesty. Imagine the pressure Tesla faced: both the world’s most powerful financier—one of the last enemies you’d want—and the world’s greatest inventor were trying to draw a bead on him and pull the trigger. Most men would’ve quietly resigned, or begged for scraps, but not Tesla.

Tesla knew that this unexplored territory would yield astounding inventions—lights could glow brighter, energy could be transmitted more efficiently and even pass through the body harmlessly. The first milestone in this new research was Tesla’s invention of what became known as the “Tesla coil.” It was a device that took normal sixty-cycle-per-second alternating current electricity and stepped it up to an ultra-high frequency of hundreds-of-thousands of cycles per second, and extremely high voltages. Tesla used his coil to invent the first high-efficiency, high-frequency fluorescent lamp. This discovery pales in comparison to what he uncovered next, however.

expensive to change. The same could be done for Westinghouse and alternating current, Coffin claimed. Westinghouse rebuffed Morgan’s offers and made it clear that their styles of business weren’t compatible. Morgan retaliated with a strategy that would become one of his hallmarks. He spread rumors to Wall Street that Westinghouse’s company was financially unstable, which dissuaded investors from giving Westinghouse the capital that he needed to expand the production and installation of his alternating current generators. Morgan then began an attack through stock manipulation, and moved to gain control of The Westinghouse Corporation, and thus Tesla’s patents. By the end of 1897, Westinghouse was nearly bankrupt, and it looked as though Morgan would usurp everything that Tesla and Westinghouse had built together. Westinghouse owed Tesla over $1 million in royalties, an amount that grew daily. When Westinghouse described to Tesla the desperate situation, Tesla replied with the following: “Mr. Westinghouse, you have been my friend, you believed in me when others had no faith; you were brave enough to go ahead when others lacked courage; you supported me when even your own engineers lacked vision. ... Here is your contract, and here is my contract. I will tear them both to pieces, and you will no longer have any troubles from my royalties.”

In time, these royalties would’ve made Tesla the world’s first billionaire. Instead, they enabled Westinghouse to save his company. Tesla’s selflessness was a testament not only to his generosity and goodwill, but his belief in his ability to continue to create his future. He was certain that his best work still lay ahead of him, and that he would soon invent machines that would dwarf everything that he had accomplished thus far. This is the beauty of imagination. An unexpected dead end in one journey is merely an opportunity to set a new course for another.

Morgan offered to fund the construction of the power plant and transmission tower necessary to pursue Tesla’s fantastical claims.

Nevertheless, Tesla chose to partner with Morgan, a decision that would prove to be the biggest mistake of his life. Tesla calculated that he would need about $1 million to construct the power station and transmission equipment.

tower could be used for more than transmitting radio signals—it could be used to saturate the entire globe with electricity harmless to living things so that everyone could obtain usable power by simply sticking wires in the soil. Morgan considered Tesla’s words carefully and coldly replied, “If anyone can draw on the power, where do we put the meter?” He refused Tesla’s pleadings for more money, forcing Tesla to use his own funds, which he knew to be insufficient to complete the project. Undaunted, Tesla approached other potential investors, including John Jacob Astor, but nobody was interested in picking up a project abandoned, and now condemned, by the most powerful man in America. Despite his continued efforts, Tesla watched in horror as his Wardenclyffe dream began to fade. Only months later, in 1904, the U.S. Patent Office stripped Tesla of his radio patents and awarded them to the Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi, instead. Marconi had used radio technology pioneered by Tesla 11 years earlier to transmit the letter “s” in morse code over 2,000 miles, which gave him no claim to the patents, of course. What did give him claim, though? He had the financial backing of Morgan, Edison, and steel baron Andrew Carnegie, all of whom held sway in every level of government. By 1905, Tesla ran out of money and was forced to lay off the Wardenclyffe workers and shut down the facility. Newspapers decried it as his “million dollar folly,” to which Tesla responded, “It is a simple feat of scientific electrical engineering, only expensive ... blind, faint-hearted doubting world.”

unsuspected source.” The following year, the Pierce-Arrow automobile manufacturer and George Westinghouse commissioned Tesla to develop an electric motor to power a car. The motor he built measured a mere 40 inches long and 30 inches across, and produced about 80 horsepower. Under the hood was the engine: a small, 12-volt storage battery and two thick wires that went from the motor to the dashboard. Tesla connected the wires to a small black box, which he had built the week before with components he bought from a local radio shop. “We now have power,” he said. This mysterious device was used to rigorously test the car for eight days, reaching speeds of 90 mph. He let nobody inspect the box, and cryptically said that it taps into a “mysterious radiation which comes out of the aether,” and that the energy is available in “limitless quantities.” The public responded superstitiously with charges of “black magic” and alliances with sinister forces of the universe. Affronted, he took his black box back with him to New York City and spoke nothing further of it. Meanwhile, Europe was again marching toward war. Tesla had long dreamed of a way to make war technologically impossible. On July, 11 1934, the New York Times ran a front-page headline that read, “TESLA, AT 78, BARES NEW ‘DEATH BEAM,’” and described a new “teleforce” invention that would send “concentrated beams of particles through the free air, of such tremendous energy that they will bring down a fleet of 10,000 enemy airplanes at a distance of 250 miles...” Tesla said that war would be unfeasible when every country had his “invisible Chinese wall.” The announcement generated considerable controversy, and Tesla was widely criticized as a “mad scientist” whose sanity was slipping. Undaunted, he approached J.P. Morgan Jr. in search of funding for a prototype, but unsurprisingly, Morgan Jr. wasn’t interested. Rumors spread that Tesla had interested the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Neville Chamberlain, but this prospect evaporated when Chamberlain resigned from his position. Frustrated by the lack of interest in his “super weapon to end all war,” Tesla sent detailed schematics to a number of Allied nations, including the United States, Canada, England, France, and the Soviet Union. None were willing to make the investment required to build the device, but two years later, one stage of the plan was tested by the USSR. They sent Tesla a check for $25,000, gave little details of their experiment, and communicated nothing further.

He also criticized Einstein’s theory of relativity, calling it a “magnificent mathematical garb which fascinates, dazzles, and makes people blind to the underlying errors.” On January 5, 1943, Tesla placed a small “do not disturb” sign on his door in the New Yorker Hotel. Two days later, the sign remained. The maid entered to find him dead in his bed. He was 86 years old. Despite receiving over 800 patents in his lifetime, and quite literally inventing the twentieth century, he died penniless and alone. A medical examination determined a blood clot in his heart was responsible for the death, and that there were no suspicious circumstances.

I share these here not because they apply to every life and offer some sort of blueprint to existence, but in the hope that they might benefit your own journey in some small way, bring you closer to your own center, or even simply invite you to reflect on your own sense of purpose.

The best ideas come to us when we stop actively trying to coax the muse into manifesting and let the fragments of experience float around our unconscious mind in order to click into new combinations. Without this essential stage of unconscious processing, the entire flow of the creative process is broken.

Presence is far more intricate and rewarding an art than productivity. Ours is a culture that measures our worth as human beings by our efficiency, our earnings, our ability to perform this or that. The cult of productivity has its place, but worshipping at its altar daily robs us of the very capacity for joy and wonder that makes life worth living — for, as Annie Dillard memorably put it, “how we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.”

I must give it to him. I want to give it to her. These two are to see if auxiliary verbs exist, or if the end of the each verb changes. A good short-cut to independent learner status, when you no longer need a teacher to improve, is to learn conjugations for “helping” verbs like “to want,” “to need,” “to have to,” “should,” etc. In Spanish and many others, this allows you to express yourself with “I need/want/must/should” + the infinite of any verb. Learning the variations of a half dozen verbs gives you access to all verbs. This doesn’t help when someone else is speaking, but it does help get the training wheels off self-expression as quickly as possible.

Action, nation, precipitation, solution, frustration, tradition, communication, extinction, and thousands of other -tion words are spelled exactly the same in French, and you can quickly get used to the different pronunciation.

There is only a general downward trend in language acquisition in adults, which is probably more dependent on environmental factors that can be changed (e.g. long job hours that crowd out study time).

The fact is, all Western consciousness of and reflection upon art have remained within the confines staked out by the Greek theory of art as mimesis or representation. It is through this theory that art as such -- above and beyond given works of art -- becomes problematic, in need of defense. And it is the defense of art which gives birth to the odd vision by which something we have learned to call "form" is separated off from something we have learned to call "content," and to the well-intentioned move which makes content essential and form accessory.

hypertrophy by increasing net protein synthesis through three important mechanisms: Induction of heat shock proteins. Robust induction of growth hormone.1 Improved insulin sensitivity. Exercise induces both protein synthesis and degradation in skeletal muscles but, again, it is the net protein synthesis that causes the actual hypertrophy. When you exercise, you are increasing the workload on the skeletal muscle and, thus, the energetic needs of your muscle cells. The mitochondria found in each of these cells kick into gear in order to help meet this demand and start sucking in the oxygen found in your blood in order to produce new energy in the form of ATP. This process is called oxidative phosphorylation. A by-product of this process, however, is the generation of oxygen free radicals like superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, which is more generally referred to simply as “oxidative stress”. Heat Stress Triggers Heat Shock Proteins That Prevent Protein Degradation Oxidative stress is a major source of protein degradation.

Heat shock proteins (or HSPs), as the name implies, are induced by heat and are a prime example of hormesis. Intermittent exposure to heat induces a hormetic response (a protective stress response), which promotes the expression of a gene called heat shock factor 1 and subsequently HSPs involved in stress resistance. HSPs can prevent damage by directly scavenging free radicals and also by supporting cellular antioxidant capacity through its effects on maintaining glutathione.8,9 HSPs can repair misfolded, damaged proteins thereby ensuring proteins have their proper structure and function.8,9

Insulin regulates protein metabolism in skeletal muscle by the two following mechanisms: It increases protein synthesis by stimulating the uptake of amino acids (particularly BCAAs) into skeletal muscle. It decreases protein degradation through inhibition of the proteasome, which is a protein complex inside cells that is largely responsible for the degradation of most cellular proteins.

In addition to increasing norepinephrine, heat acclimation has actually been shown to increase biological capacity to store norepinephrine for later release. In light of the fact that the norepinephrine response to exercise has been demonstrated to be blunted in children with ADHD and that norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRI) are frequently prescribed to treat ADHD (among other things), use of heat stress and subsequent acclimation should be tested for it’s effectiveness as an interesting alternative therapeutic approach.

BDNF’s role in the brain is also to modulate neuronal plasticity and long-term memory, while also having been shown to ameliorate anxiety and depression from early-life stressful events. In addition to the function BDNF plays in the brain when it’s released as a consequence of exercise, BDNF is also secreted by muscle where it plays a role in muscle repair and the growth of new muscle cells.

Beta-endorphins are endogenous (natural) opioids that are a part of the body’s natural painkiller system, known as the mu opioid system, which block pain messages from spreading from the body to the brain in a process called antinociception. What is lesser known is that the body also produces a peptide known as dynorphin (a “kappa opioid”), which is generally responsible for the sensation of dysphoria. The discomfort experienced during intense exercise, exposure to extreme heat (such as in a sauna), or eating spicy food (capsaicin) is due to the release of dynorphin. The release of dynorphin causes an upregulation and sensitization of mu opioid receptors, which interact with beta-endorphin. This process is what underlies the “runner’s high” and is directly precipitated by the discomfort of physical exercise. Translation: the greater the discomfort experienced during your workout or sauna, the better the endorphin high will be afterward. Now you understand the underlying biological mechanism that explains this.

In Conclusion To recap and drive the point home: acclimating your body to heat stress by intermittent whole-body hyperthermia via sauna use (“hyperthermic conditioning”) has been shown to: Enhance endurance by: Increasing nutrient delivery to muscles thereby reducing the depletion of glycogen stores. Reducing heart rate and reducing core temperature during workload. Increase muscle hypertrophy by preventing protein degradation through the following three means: Induction of heat shock proteins and a hormetic response (which has also been shown to increase longevity in lower organisms). Cause a massive release of growth hormone. Improving insulin sensitivity. Hyperthermic conditioning also has robust positive effects on the brain: Increases the storage and release of norepinephrine, which improves attention and focus. Increases prolactin, which causes your brain to function faster by enhancing myelination and helps to repair damaged neurons. Increases BDNF, which causes the growth of new brain cells, improves the ability for you to retain new information, and ameliorates certain types of depression and anxiety. Causes a robust increase in dynorphin, which results in your body becoming more sensitive to the ensuing endorphins. Life is stressful. When you exercise, you are forcing your body to become more resilient to stress (somewhat paradoxically) through stress itself. Hyperthermic conditioning is a novel and possibly effective tool

TIM: I don’t quantify the profitability of each piece of content, as it would affect my editorial purity and stymie my curiosity to explore things on the edges… yet that’s precisely what’s built my reputation, if I have one! I write about what most excites me and assume that will hold true for 10,000+ people… if I write about it well. If I get 100 die-hard fans per post like that, I can build an army that will not only consider buying anything I sell later (assuming high quality — most critical!), but they’ll also promote my work as trustworthy to other people. This compounds quickly. The product — here writing — needs to stand on its own two feet. Furthermore, it’s much more interesting to me to sell something like a small-scale, $10,000-per-seat seminar every 2-3 years, instead of obsessing over monthly, weekly, or even daily Amazon commissions, for instance.

Gewiß, du hast recht, Bester, der Schmerzen wären minder unter den Menschen, wenn sie nicht — Gott weiß, warum sie so gemacht sind! — mit so viel Emsigkeit der Einbildungskraft sich beschäftigten, die Erinnerungen des vergangenen Übels zurückzurufen, eher als eine gleichgültige Gegenwart zu ertragen.

But the idea behind Pascal’s wager has fundamental applications outside of theology. It stands the entire notion of knowledge on its head. It eliminates the need for us to understand the probabilities of a rare event (there are fundamental limits to our knowledge of these); rather, we can focus on the payoff and benefits of an event if it takes place. The probabilities of very rare events are not computable; the effect of an event on us is considerably easier to ascertain (the rarer the event, the fuzzier the odds). We can have a clear idea of the consequences of an event, even if we do not know how likely it is to occur. I don’t know the odds of an earthquake, but I can imagine how San Francisco might be affected by one. This idea that in order to make a decision you need to focus on the consequences (which you can know) rather than the probability (which you can’t know) is the central idea of uncertainty. Much of my life is based on it.

A similar effect is taking place in economic life. I spoke about globalization in Chapter 3; it is here, but it is not all for the good: it creates interlocking fragility, while reducing volatility and giving the appearance of stability. In other words it creates devastating Black Swans. We have never lived before under the threat of a global collapse. Financial institutions have been merging into a smaller number of very large banks. Almost all banks are now interrelated. So the financial ecology is swelling into gigantic, incestuous, bureaucratic banks (often Gaussianized in their risk measurement)—when one falls, they all fall.*

Standard deviations do not exist outside the Gaussian, or if they do exist they do not matter and do not explain much. But it gets worse. The Gaussian family (which includes various friends and relatives, such as the Poisson law) are the only class of distributions that the standard deviation (and the average) is sufficient to describe. You need nothing else. The bell curve satisfies the reductionism of the deluded.

variation. At their very best, practical rules state probabilities, not certainties; a relative constancy of connection is all that exists, but it is enough to serve as a guide in life. Aristotle here holds the balance between a misleading hope of reducing the subject-matter of conduct to a few simple rigorous abstract principles, with conclusions necessarily issuing from them, and the view that it is the field of operation of inscrutable forces acting without predictable regularity. He does not pretend to find in it absolute uniformities, or to deduce the details from his principles. Hence, too, he insists on the necessity of experience as the source or test of all that he has to say. Moral experience—the actual possession and exercise of good character—is necessary truly to understand moral principles and profitably to apply them. The mere intellectual apprehension of them is not possible, or if possible, profitless.

This condition was to the Greeks a matter of only too frequent experience, but it appeared to them peculiarly difficult to understand. How can a man know what is good or best for him, and yet chronically fail to act upon his knowledge? Socrates was driven to the paradox of denying the possibility, but the facts are too strong for him. Knowledge of the right rule may be present, nay the rightfulness of its authority may be acknowledged, and yet time after time it may be disobeyed; the will may be good and yet overmastered by the force of desire, so that the act done is contrary to the agent's will.

The strategy for the discoverers and entrepreneurs is to rely less on top-down planning and focus on maximum tinkering and recognizing opportunities when they present themselves. So I disagree with the followers of Marx and those of Adam Smith: the reason free markets work is because they allow people to be lucky, thanks to aggressive trial and error, not by giving rewards or “incentives” for skill. The strategy is, then, to tinker as much as possible and try to collect as many Black Swan opportunities as you can.

The story of the exodus from Egypt, the wandering in the desert for forty years, and the entry into the promised land, said Philo, was really an allegory of the individual soul's emancipation, tribulations, and final deliverance. Interpretation thus presupposes a discrepancy between the clear meaning of the text and the demands of (later) readers. It seeks to resolve that discrepancy.

The modern style of interpretation excavates, and as it excavates, destroys; it digs "behind" the text, to find a sub-text which is the true one. The most celebrated and influential modern doctrines, those of Marx and Freud, actually amount to elaborate systems of hermeneutics, aggressive and impious theories of interpretation. All observable phenomena are bracketed, in Freud's phrase, as manifest content. This manifest content must be probed and pushed aside to find the true meaning -- the latent content -- beneath. For Marx, social events like revolutions and wars; for Freud, the events of individual lives (like neurotic symptoms and slips of the tongue) as well as texts (like a dream or a work of art) -- all are treated as occasions for interpretation. According to Marx and Freud, these events only seem to be intelligible. Actually, they have no meaning without interpretation. To understand is to interpret. And to interpret is to restate the phenomenon, in effect to find an equivalent for it.

Recall that in science, synthesis is the process of inferring effects from given causes; whereas analysis is the route by which we seek the causes of observed effects. Loosely speaking, using this first definition of synthesis, analysis is the opposite of synthesis. In broader usage synthesis indicates combining components to form something new that has properties not found in its components (we’ll call this definition 2). I’ll touch on the consequence of conflating the two definitions of synthesis below.

The destructive connotation of analysis only applies when value judgment is attached to physical decomposition. You analyze a frog by dissecting it (murderer!). You analyze a clock by disassembling it – no, by tearing it apart. This wording needlessly condemns the concept of analysis from the start.

Much of what other people know isn’t worth knowing. The most severe mistake made in life is to mistake the unintelligible for the unintelligent. Socrates’ technique was to make his interlocutor, who started with a thesis, agree to a series of statements, then proceed to show him how the statements he agreed to are inconsistent with the original thesis, thus establishing that he has no clue as to what he was taking about. Socrates used it mostly to show people how lacking in clarity they were in their thoughts, how little they knew about the concepts they used routinely - and the need for philosophy to elucidate these concepts.

The best way past a plateau is to jostle yourself beyond it; to change your practice method so you disrupt your autopilot and rebuild a faster, better circuit. One way to do this is to speed things up - to force yourself to do the task faster than you normally would. Or you can slow things down - going so slowly that you highlight previously undetected mistakes. Or you can do the task in reverse order, turn it inside out or upside down.

This DNA can be regarded as a set of instructions for how to make a body, written in the ATCG alphabet of the nucleotides. It is as though, in every room of a gigantic building, there was a book-case containing the architect’s plans for the entire building. The ‘book-case’ in a cell is called the nucleus. The architect’s plans run to 46 volumes in man - the number is different in other species. The ‘volumes’ are called chromosomes. They are visible under a microscope as long threads, and the genes are strung out along them in order.

Think of the old cliché about quote the mind being an excellent servant but a terrible master. This, like many clichés, so lame and unexciting on the surface, actually expresses a great and terrible truth. It is not the least bit coincidental that adults who commit suicide with firearms almost always shoot themselves in: the head. They shoot the terrible master.

unconscious, a slave to your head and to your natural default setting of being uniquely, completely, imperially alone day in and day out. That may sound like hyperbole, or abstract nonsense. Let's get concrete. The plain fact is that you graduating seniors do not yet have any clue what "day in day out" really means. There happen to be whole, large parts of adult American life that nobody talks about in commencement speeches. One such part involves boredom, routine, and petty frustration.

The “primary consciousness,” the basic mind which knows reality rather than ideas about it, does not know the future. It lives completely in the present, and perceives nothing more than what is at this moment. The ingenious brain, however, looks at that part of present experience called memory, and by studying it is able to make predictions. These predictions are, relatively, so accurate and reliable (e.g., “everyone will die”) that the future assumes a high degree of reality — so high that the present loses its value. But the future is still not here, and cannot become a part of experienced reality until it is present.

Since what we know of the future is made up of purely abstract and logical elements — inferences, guesses, deductions — it cannot be eaten, felt, smelled, seen, heard, or otherwise enjoyed. To pursue it is to pursue a constantly retreating phantom, and the faster you chase it, the faster it runs ahead. This is why all the affairs of civilization are rushed, why hardly anyone enjoys what he has, and is forever seeking more and more. Happiness, then, will consist, not of solid and substantial realities, but of such abstract and superficial things as promises, hopes, and assurances.

There must be a good “I” who is going to improve the bad “me.” “I,” who has the best intentions, will go to work on wayward “me,” and the tussle between the two will very much stress the difference between them. Consequently “I” will feel more separate than ever, and so merely increase the lonely and cut-off feelings which make “me” behave so badly.

To stand face to face with insecurity is still not to understand it. To understand it, you must not face it but be it. It is like the Persian story of the sage who came to the door of Heaven and knocked. From within the voice of God asked, “Who is there” and the sage answered, “It is I.” “In this House,” replied the voice, “there is no room for thee and me.” So the sage went away, and spent many years pondering over this answer in deep meditation. Returning a second time, the voice asked the same question, and again the sage answered, “It is I.” The door remained closed. After some years he returned for the third time, and, at his knocking, the voice once more demanded, “Who is there?” And the sage cried, “It is thyself!” The door was opened.

Procedural memory is a type of long-term memory and, more specifically, a type of implicit memory. Procedural memory is created through "procedural learning" or, repeating a complex activity over and over again until all of the relevant neural systems work together to automatically produce the activity. Implicit procedural learning is essential for the development of any motor skill or cognitive activity.

This attention to the step-by-step procedure disrupts the well-learned, automatic (proceduralized) performance. What was once an effortless and unconscious retrieval execution of a procedural memory becomes slow and deliberate.

evidence showing that no improvement on tasks is shown following a short, non-rapid eye movement (NREM; stages 2–4) sleep, such as a nap. REM sleep following a period of slow-wave sleep (SWS; combined stage 3 and 4 and the deepest form of NREM sleep), has shown to be the most beneficial type of sleep for procedural memory enhancement, especially when it takes place immediately after the initial acquisition of a skill. So essentially, a full night (or day) of uninterrupted sleep soon after learning a skill will allow for the most memory consolidation possible. Furthermore, if REM sleep is disrupted, there is no gain in procedural performance shown

Slow-Wave Sleep, often referred to as deep sleep, plays the most important role in consolidation of declarative memory and there is a large amount of evidence to support this claim. One study found that the first 3.5 hours of sleep offer the greatest performance enhancement on memory recall tasks because the first couple of hours are dominated by SWS. Additional hours of sleep do not add to the initial level of performance. Thus this study suggests that full sleep may not be important for optimal performance of memory.

abwärts. In dieser Zeit hörte ich zuerst den Namen Goethe und erlangte zuerst einen Band seiner Gedichte. Ich las seine Lieder, und las sie immer von neuem, und genoß dabei ein Glück, das keine Worte schildern. Es war mir, als fange ich erst an aufzuwachen und zum eigentlichen Bewußtsein zu gelangen; es kam mir vor, als werde mir in diesen Liedern mein eigenes mir bisher unbekanntes Innere zurückgespiegelt. Auch stieß ich nirgends auf etwas Fremdartiges und Gelehrtes, wozu mein bloß menschliches Denken und Empfinden nicht ausgereicht hätte, nirgends auf Namen ausländischer und veralteter Gottheiten, wobei ich mir nichts zu denken wußte; vielmehr fand ich das menschliche Herz in allen seinem Verlangen, Glück und Leiden, ich fand eine deutsche Natur wie der gegenwärtige helle Tag, eine reine Wirklichkeit in dem Lichte milder Verklärung.

Alle jungen Dichter in Deutschland müßten es wissen, es könnte ihnen helfen. Er leitete das Gespräch ein, indem er mich fragte, ob ich diesen Sommer keine Gedichte gemacht. Ich antwortete ihm, daß ich zwar einige gemacht, daß es mir aber im ganzen dazu an Behagen gefehlt. »Nehmen Sie sich in acht«, sagte er darauf, »vor einer großen Arbeit. Das ists eben, woran unsere Besten leiden, gerade diejenigen, in denen das meiste Talent und das tüchtigste Streben vorhanden. Ich habe auch daran gelitten und weiß, was es mir geschadet hat. Was ist da nicht alles in den Brunnen gefallen! Wenn ich alles gemacht hätte, was ich recht gut hätte machen können, es würden keine hundert Bände reichen. Die Gegenwart will ihre Rechte; was sich täglich im Dichter von Gedanken und Empfindungen aufdrängt, das will und soll ausgesprochen sein. Hat man aber ein größeres Werk im Kopfe, so kann nichts daneben aufkommen, so werden alle Gedanken zurückgewiesen, und man ist für die Behaglichkeit des Lebens selbst so lange verloren. Welche Anstrengung und Verwendung von Geisteskraft gehört nicht dazu, um nur ein großes Ganzes in sich zu ordnen und abzurunden, und welche Kräfte und welche ruhige ungestörte Lage im Leben, um es dann in einem Fluß gehörig auszusprechen. Hat man sich nun im Ganzen vergriffen, so ist alle Mühe verloren; ist man ferner, bei einem so umfangreichen Gegenstande, in einzelnen Teilen nicht völlig Herr seines Stoffes, so wird das Ganze stellenweise mangelhaft werden, und man wird gescholten; und aus allem entspringt für den Dichter statt Belohnung und Freude für so viele Mühe und Aufopferung nichts als Unbehagen und Lähmung der Kräfte. Faßt dagegen der Dichter täglich die Gegenwart auf, und behandelt er immer gleich in frischer Stimmung, was sich ihm darbietet, so macht er sich immer etwas Gutes, und gelingt ihm auch einmal etwas nicht, so ist nichts daran verloren. Da ist der August Hagen in Königsberg, ein herrliches Talent; haben Sie seine ›Olfried und Lisena‹ gelesen ? Da sind Stellen darin, wie sie nicht besser sein können; die Zustände an der Ostsee, und was sonst in dortige Lokalität hineinschlägt, alles meisterhaft. Aber es sind nur schöne Stellen, als Ganzes will es niemanden behagen. Und welche Mühe und welche Kräfte hat er daran verwendet! ja er hat sich fast daran erschöpft. Jetzt hat er ein Trauerspiel gemacht!«

Hagen in ›Kunst und Altertum‹ geraten, nur kleine Gegenstände zu behandeln. »Freilich habe ich das,« erwiderte Goethe; »aber tut man denn, was wir Alten sagen? Jeder glaubt, er müsse es doch selber am besten wissen, und dabei geht mancher verloren, und mancher hat lange daran zu irren. Es ist aber jetzt keine Zeit mehr zum Irren, dazu sind wir Alten gewesen; und was hätte uns alle unser Suchen und Irren geholfen, wenn ihr jüngeren Leute wieder dieselbigen Wege laufen wolltet? Da kämen wir ja nie weiter! Uns Alten rechnet man den Irrtum zugute, weil wir die Wege nicht gebahnt fanden; wer aber später in die Welt eintritt, von dem verlangt man mehr, der soll nicht abermals irren und suchen, sondern er soll den Rat der Alten nutzen und gleich auf gutem Wege fortschreiten.

Machen Sie vorderhand, wie gesagt, immer nur kleine Gegenstände, immer alles frischweg, was sich Ihnen täglich darbietet, so werden Sie in der Regel immer etwas Gutes leisten, und jeder Tag wird Ihnen Freude bringen. Geben Sie es zunächst in die Taschenbücher, in die Zeitschriften; aber fügen Sie sich nie fremden Anforderungen, sondern machen Sie es immer nach Ihrem eigenen Sinn. Die Welt ist so groß und reich und das Leben so mannigfaltig, daß es an Anlässen zu Gedichten nie fehlen wird.

Vorteil bei kleinen Sachen, daß man nur solche Gegenstände zu wählen braucht und wählen wird, die man kennet, von denen man Herr ist. Bei einem großen dichterischen Werk geht das aber nicht, da läßt sich nicht ausweichen, alles, was zur Verknüpfung des Ganzen gehört und in den Plan hinein mit verflochten ist, muß dargestellt werden, und zwar mit getroffener Wahrheit. Bei der Jugend aber ist die Kenntnis der Dinge noch einseitig; ein großes Werk aber erfordert Vielseitigkeit, und daran scheitert man.«

Besonders warne ich vor eigenen großen Erfindungen; denn da will man eine Ansicht der Dinge geben, und die ist in der Jugend selten reif. Ferner: Charaktere und Ansichten lösen sich als Seiten des Dichters von ihm ab und berauben ihn für fernere Produktionen der Fülle. Und endlich: welche Zeit geht nicht an der Erfindung und inneren Anordnung und Verknüpfung verloren, worauf uns niemand etwas zugute tut, vorausgesetzt, daß wir überhaupt mit unserer Arbeit zustande kommen. Bei einem gegebenen Stoff hingegen ist alles anders und leichter. Da werden Fakta und Charaktere überliefert, und der Dichter hat nur die Belebung des Ganzen. Auch bewahrt er dabei seine eigene Fülle, denn er braucht nur wenig von dem Seinigen hinzuzutun auch ist der Verlust von Zeit und Kräften bei weitem geringer, denn er hat nur die Mühe der Ausführung. Ja, ich rate sogar zu schon bearbeiteten Gegenständen. Wie oft ist nicht die Iphigenie gemacht, und doch sind alle verschieden; denn jeder sieht und stellt die Sachen anders, eben nach seiner Weise.

Ich fragte darauf Goethe um seine Meinung hinsichtlich der Verse zur deutschen Tragödie. »Man wird sich in Deutschland«, antwortete er, »schwerlich darüber vereinigen. Jeder macht's wie er eben will und wie es dem Gegenstande einigermaßen gemäß ist. Der sechsfüßige Jambus wäre freilich am würdigsten, allein er ist für uns Deutsche zu lang; wir sind wegen der mangelnden Beiwörter gewöhnlich schon mit fünf Füßen fertig.

Nur zwei Worte will ich Ihnen über die Gedichte sagen. Sie stehen jetzt auf dem Punkt, wo Sie notwendig zum eigentlich Hohen und Schweren der Kunst durchbrechen müssen, zur Auffassung des Individuellen. Sie müssen mit Gewalt, damit Sie aus der Idee herauskommen; Sie haben das Talent und sind so weit vorgeschritten, jetzt müssen Sie. Sie sind dieser Tage in Tiefurt gewesen, das möchte ich Ihnen zunächst zu einer solchen Aufgabe machen. Sie können vielleicht noch drei- bis viermal hingehen und Tiefurt betrachten, ehe Sie ihm die charakteristische Seite abgewinnen und alle Motive beisammen haben; doch scheuen Sie die Mühe nicht, studieren Sie alles wohl und stellen Sie es dar; der Gegenstand verdient es. Ich selbst hätte es längst gemacht; allein ich kann es nicht, ich habe jene bedeutenden Zustände selbst mit durchlebt, ich bin zu sehr darin befangen, so daß die Einzelnheiten sich mir in zu großer Fülle aufdrängen. Sie aber kommen als Fremder und lassen sich vom Kastellan das Vergangene erzählen und sehen nur das Gegenwärtige, Hervorstechende, Bedeutende.« Ich versprach, mich daran zu versuchen, obgleich ich nicht leugnen könne, daß es eine Aufgabe sei, die mir sehr fern stehe und die ich für sehr schwierig halte. »Ich weiß wohl,« sagte Goethe, »daß es schwer ist, aber die Auffassung und Darstellung des Besonderen ist auch das eigentliche Leben der Kunst. Und dann: solange man sich im Allgemeinen hält, kann es uns jeder nachmachen; aber das Besondere macht uns niemand nach. Warum? Weil es die anderen nicht erlebt haben. Auch braucht man nicht zu fürchten, daß das Besondere keinen Anklang finde. Jeder Charakter, so eigentümlich er sein möge, und jedes Darzustellende, vom Stein herauf bis zum Menschen, hat Allgemeinheit; denn alles wiederholt sich, und es gibt kein Ding in der Welt, das nur einmal da wäre. Auf dieser Stufe der individuellen Darstellung«, fuhr Goethe fort, »beginnet dann zugleich dasjenige, was man Komposition nennet.«

Infolge dieses Stückes machte ich nachstehende Bemerkung. Von einem Dichter nur mittelmäßig gezeichnete Charaktere werden bei der Theaterdarstellung gewinnen, weil die Schauspieler, als lebendige Menschen, sie zu lebendigen Wesen machen und ihnen zu irgendeiner Art von Individualität verhelfen. Von einem großen Dichter meisterhaft gezeichnete Charaktere dagegen, die schon alle mit einer durchaus scharfen Individualität dastehen, müssen bei der Darstellung notwendig verlieren, weil die Schauspieler in der Regel nicht durchaus passen und die wenigsten ihre eigene Individualität so sehr verleugnen können. Findet sich beim Schauspieler nicht ganz das Gleiche, oder besitzt er nicht die Gabe einer gänzlichen Ablegung seiner eigenen Persönlichkeit, so entsteht ein Gemisch, und der Charakter verliert seine Reinheit. Daher kommt es denn, daß ein Stück eines wirklich großen Dichters immer nur in einzelnen Figuren so zur Erscheinung kommt, wie es die ursprüngliche Intention war.

Da malen sie z. B. meinen ›Fischer‹ und bedenken nicht, daß sich das gar nicht malen lasse.

»Dazu,« sagte Goethe, »ist der Gegenstand nicht bedeutend genug. Die sogenannte didaktisch-beschreibende Form würde zwar im ganzen die zu wählende sein, allein auch sie ist nicht durchgreifend passend. Am besten ist es, Sie stellen den Gegenstand in zehn bis zwölf kleinen einzelnen Gedichten dar, in Reimen, aber in mannigfaltigen Versarten und Formen, so wie es die verschiedenen Seiten und Ansichten verlangen, wodurch denn das Ganze wird umschrieben und beleuchtet sein.« Diesen Rat ergriff ich als zweckmäßig. »Ja, was hindert Sie, dabei auch einmal dramatisch zu verfahren und ein Gespräch etwa mit dem Gärtner führen zu lassen? Und durch diese Zerstückelung macht man es sich leicht und kann besser das Charakteristische der verschiedenen Seiten des Gegenstandes ausdrücken. Ein umfassendes größeres Ganze dagegen ist immer schwierig, und man bringt selten etwas Vollendetes zustande.«

Ich sprach darauf mit Goethe sowohl über den Gegenstand als die Behandlung, wo mir denn durch einige seiner Andeutungen manches lebendiger entgegentrat. »Freilich,« sagte er darauf, »die Behandlung ist sehr knapp, und man muß gut eindringen, wenn man es recht besitzen will. Es kommt mir selber vor wie eine aus Stahldrähten geschmiedete Damaszenerklinge. Ich habe aber auch den Gegenstand vierzig Jahre mit mir herumgetragen, so daß er denn freilich Zeit hatte, sich von allem Ungehörigen zu läutern.« »Es wird Wirkung tun,«sagte ich, »wenn es beim Publikum hervortritt.« »Ach, das Publikum!« seufzete Goethe. »Sollte es nicht gut sein,« sagte ich, »wenn man dem Verständnis zu Hülfe käme und es machte wie bei der Erklärung eines Gemäldes, wo man durch Vorführung der vorhergegangenen Momente das wirklich Gegenwärtige zu beleben sucht?« »Ich bin nicht der Meinung«, sagte Goethe. »Mit Gemälden ist es ein anderes; weil aber ein Gedicht gleichfalls aus Worten besteht, so hebt ein Wort das andere auf.« Goethe scheint mir hierdurch sehr treffend die Klippe angedeutet zu haben, woran Ausleger von Gedichten gewöhnlich scheitern.

»Es geht mir mit Schiller eigen,« sagte ich; »einige Szenen seiner großen Theaterstücke lese ich mit wahrer Liebe und Bewunderung, dann aber komme ich auf Verstöße gegen die Wahrheit der Natur, und ich kann nicht weiter. Selbst mit dem ›Wallenstein‹ geht es mir nicht anders. Ich kann nicht umhin, zu glauben, daß Schillers philosophische Richtung seiner Poesie geschadet hat; denn durch sie kam er dahin, die Idee höher zu halten als alle Natur, ja die Natur dadurch zu vernichten. Was er sich denken konnte, mußte geschehen, es mochte nun der Natur gemäß oder ihr zuwider sein.« »Es ist betrübend,« sagte Goethe, »wenn man sieht, wie ein so außerordentlich begabter Mensch sich mit philosophischen Denkweisen herumquälte, die ihm nichts helfen konnten. Humboldt hat mir Briefe mitgebracht, die Schiller in der unseligen Zeit jener Spekulationen an ihn geschrieben. Man sieht daraus, wie er sich damals mit der Intention plagte, die sentimentale Poesie von der naiven ganz frei zu machen. Aber nun konnte er für jene Dichtart keinen Boden finden, und dies brachte ihn in unsägliche Verwirrung. Und als ob«, fügte Goethe lächelnd hinzu, »die sentimentale Poesie ohne einen naiven Grund, aus welchem sie gleichsam hervorwächst, nur irgend bestehen könnte! Es war nicht Schillers Sache,« fuhr Goethe fort, »mit einer gewissen Bewußtlosigkeit und gleichsam instinktmäßig zu verfahren, vielmehr mußte er über jedes, was er tat, reflektieren; woher es auch kam, daß er über seine poetischen Vorsätze nicht unterlassen konnte, sehr viel hin und her zu reden, so daß er alle seine späteren Stücke Szene für Szene mit mir durchgesprochen hat. Dagegen war es ganz gegen meine Natur, über das, was ich von poetischen Plänen vorhatte, mit irgend jemanden zu reden, selbst nicht mit Schiller. Ich trug alles still mit mir herum, und niemand erfuhr in der Regel etwas, als bis es vollendet war. Als ich Schillern meinen ›Hermann und Dorothea‹ fertig vorlegte, war er verwundert, denn ich hatte ihm vorher mit keiner Silbe gesagt, daß ich dergleichen vorhatte.

»Sie sehen das Produkt eines höchst leidenschaftlichen Zustandes,« fügte er hinzu; »als ich darin befangen war, hätte ich ihn um alles in der Welt nicht entbehren mögen, und jetzt möchte ich um keinen Preis wieder hineingeraten. Ich schrieb das Gedicht, unmittelbar als ich von Marienbad abreiste und ich mich noch im vollen frischen Gefühle des Erlebten befand. Morgens acht Uhr auf der ersten Station schrieb ich die erste Strophe, und so dichtete ich im Wagen fort und schrieb von Station zu Station das im Gedächtnis Gefaßte nieder, so daß es abends fertig auf dem Papiere stand. Es hat daher eine gewisse Unmittelbarkeit und ist wie aus einem Gusse, welches dem Ganzen zugute kommen mag.«

»Überhaupt«, sagte Goethe, »treibt man auf Akademien viel zu viel und gar zu viel Unnützes. Auch dehnen die einzelnen Lehrer ihre Fächer zu weit aus, bei weitem über die Bedürfnisse der Hörer. In früherer Zeit wurde Chemie und Botanik als zur Arzneikunde gehörig vorgetragen, und der Mediziner hatte daran genug. Jetzt aber sind Chemie und Botanik eigene unübersehbare Wissenschaften geworden, deren jede ein ganzes Menschenleben erfordert, und man will sie dem Mediziner mit zumuten! Daraus aber kann nichts werden; das eine wird über das andere unterlassen und vergessen. Wer klug ist, lehnet daher alle zerstreuende Anforderungen ab und beschränkt sich auf ein Fach und wird tüchtig in einem.«

Und dann ist die Zeit ein wunderlich Ding. Sie ist ein Tyrann, der seine Launen hat und der zu dem, was einer sagt und tut, in jedem Jahrhundert ein ander Gesicht macht. Was den alten Griechen zu sagen erlaubt war, will uns zu sagen nicht mehr anstehen, und was Shakespeares kräftigen Mitmenschen durchaus anmutete, kann der Engländer von 1820 nicht mehr ertragen, so daß in der neuesten Zeit ein Family-Shakespeare ein gefühltes Bedürfnis wird.« »Auch liegt sehr vieles in der Form«, fügte ich hinzu. »Das eine jener beiden Gedichte, in dem Ton und Versmaß der Alten, hat weit weniger Zurückstoßendes. Einzelne Motive sind allerdings an sich widerwärtig, allein die Behandlung wirft über das Ganze so viel Großheit und Würde, daß es uns wird, als hörten wir einen kräftigen Alten, und als wären wir in die Zeit griechischer Heroen zurückversetzt. Das andere Gedicht dagegen, in dem Ton und der Versart von Meister Ariost, ist weit verfänglicher. Es behandelt ein Abenteuer von heute, in der Sprache von heute, und indem es dadurch ohne alle Umhüllung ganz in unsere Gegenwart hereintritt, erscheinen die einzelnen Kühnheiten bei weitem verwegener.« »Sie haben recht,«

Pattern recognition - spotting a wave early and casually drifting to the sweet spot. Pattern recognition seems to come with experience and practice. While logging hours of practice helps us see patterns subconsciously, we can often do just as well by deliberately looking for them. Pattern hunting and deliberate analysis can yield results with high accuracy on the first try. Deliberate pattern spotting can compensate for experience. But we often don’t even give it a shot.

Man kann zum Vorteile der Regeln viel sagen, ungefähr was man zum Lobe der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft sagen kann. Ein Mensch, der sich nach ihnen bildet, wird nie etwas Abgeschmacktes und Schlechtes hervorbringen, wie einer, der sich durch Gesetze und Wohlstand modeln läßt, nie ein unerträglicher Nachbar, nie ein merkwürdiger Bösewicht werden kann; dagegen wird aber auch alle Regel, man rede was man wolle, das wahre Gefühl von Natur und den wahren Ausdruck derselben zerstören!

The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes, directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.

The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his “natural superiors,” and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous “cash payment.” It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless and indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom—Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation. The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage labourers. The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation.

Ich habe einen Menschen immer nur als ein für sich bestehendes Individuum angesehen, das ich zu erforschen und das ich in seiner Eigentümlichkeit kennen zu lernen trachtete, wovon ich aber durchaus keine weitere Sympathie verlange. Dadurch habe ich es nun dahin gebracht, mit jedem Menschen umgehen zu können, und dadurch allein entsteht die Kenntnis mannigfaltiger Charaktere sowie die nötige Gewandtheit im Leben. Denn gerade bei widerstrebenden Naturen muß man sich zusammennehmen, um mit ihnen durchzukommen, und dadurch werden alle die verschiedenen Seiten in uns angeregt und zur Entwickelung und Ausbildung gebracht, so daß man sich denn bald jedem Vis-à-vis gewachsen fühlt.

Gegenstände, über die falsche Tendenz solcher Künstler, welche die Religion zur Kunst machen wollen, während ihnen die Kunst Religion sein sollte. »Die Religion«, sagte Goethe, »steht in demselbigen Verhältnis zur Kunst wie jedes andere höhere Lebensinteresse auch. Sie ist bloß als Stoff zu betrachten, der mit allen übrigen Lebensstoffen gleiche Rechte hat. Auch sind Glaube und Unglaube durchaus nicht diejenigen Organe, mit welchen ein Kunstwerk aufzufassen ist, vielmehr gehören dazu ganz andere menschliche Kräfte und Fähigkeiten.

»Wenn einer fünfundsiebzig Jahre alt ist,« fuhr er darauf mit großer Heiterkeit fort, »kann es nicht fehlen, daß er mitunter an den Tod denke. Mich läßt dieser Gedanke in völliger Ruhe, denn ich habe die feste Überzeugung, daß unser Geist ein Wesen ist ganz unzerstörbarer Natur; es ist ein fortwirkendes von Ewigkeit zu Ewigkeit. Es ist der Sonne ähnlich, die bloß unsern irdischen Augen unterzugehen scheint, die aber eigentlich nie untergeht, sondern unaufhörlich fortleuchtet.«

Napoleon erbte die Französische Revolution, Friedrich der Große den Schlesischen Krieg, Luther die Finsternis der Pfaffen, und mir ist der Irrtum der Newtonischen Lehre zuteil geworden. Die gegenwärtige Generation hat zwar keine Ahnung, was hierin von mir geleistet worden; doch künftige Zeiten werden gestehen, daß mir keineswegs eine schlechte Erbschaft zugefallen.« Goethe hatte

Wir sprachen darauf über die manchen Jahre seiner Theaterleitung, und welche unendliche Zeit er damit für sein schriftstellerisches Wirken verloren. »Freilich,« sagte Goethe, »ich hätte indes manches gute Stück schreiben können, doch wenn ich es recht bedenke, gereut es mich nicht.

Establishing a link requires nothing but your attention. Put your attention on something and you immediately connect with it. The best way to fulfill our desires is to walk up to whatever interests us and engage with it directly. You communicate effectively by first connecting with the familiar and then branching out into the unfamiliar. When you meet someone new, the first step is to discover your shared interests, values, and attitudes. This creates a basic bond of trust and friendship. The next step is to explore and learn from your differences. Don't forget that the primary purpose of communication is to create a connection with the other person.

This solution is simple, elegant, and wrong. High overhead costs are only one possible failure mode for a charity. Consider again the Arctic explorer, trying to decide between a $200 parka and a $200 digital camera. Perhaps a parka only cost $100 to make and the manufacturer takes $100 profit, but the camera cost $200 to make and the manufacturer is selling it at cost. This speaks in favor of the moral qualities of the camera manufacturer, but given the choice the explorer should still buy the parka. The camera does something useless very efficiently, the parka does something vital inefficiently. A parka sold at cost would be best, but in its absence the explorer shouldn't hesitate to choose the the parka over the camera. The same applies to charity.

Solving some social problems would provide enormous benefits, but if they are extremely hard to make progress on, they are poor opportunities. Inventing a perpetual motion machine would solve the energy crisis, but according to current physics, designing a perpetual motion machine is impossible whereas improving solar panel technology is not.

How strong is the evidence behind existing interventions in this cause? If the effectiveness of the interventions with this cause is an an empirical question, where does the evidence lie on the hierarchy of evidence, running from only anecdotal evidence to meta-analysis? Is there a theory for why these interventions should work that’s widely accepted by experts? Is there a track record of success in related areas? How many resources will be required to implement these interventions? Do you expect to be able to discover new promising interventions within this cause?

The standard measure in global health is the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY). This measures the disvalue of health conditions in terms of the number of years of life lost due to the condition plus the number of years lived with disability multiplied by a number representing the severity of the disability. For example, a condition that caused one to die 5 years prematurely and to live the last 10 years with deafness would be valued as 5 + (10 x 33.3%) = 8.33 DALYs.

Man sieht ihm an, daß er das Leben recht durchgemacht hat, wozu ihm denn eine Stadt wie Paris die beste Gelegenheit geboten.« Ich machte bemerklich, daß solche Bilder zum besseren Verstehen des Gedichts sehr viel beitrügen. »Das ist keine Frage,« sagte Goethe; »denn die vollkommene Einbildungskraft eines solchen Künstlers zwingt uns, die Situationen so gut zu denken, wie er sie selber gedacht hat. Und wenn ich nun gestehen muß, daß Herr Delacroix meine eigene Vorstellung bei Szenen übertroffen hat, die ich selber gemacht habe, um wie viel mehr werden nicht die Leser alles lebendig und über ihre Imagination hinausgehend finden!«

»Man sieht,« sagte Goethe, »der junge Mann hat Talent; allein daß er alles von selbst gelernt hat, deswegen soll man ihn nicht loben, sondern schelten. Ein Talent wird nicht geboren, um sich selbst überlassen zu bleiben, sondern sich zur Kunst und guten Meistern zu wenden, die denn etwas aus ihm machen. Ich habe dieser Tage einen Brief von Mozart gelesen, wo er einem Baron, der ihm Kompositionen zugesendet hatte, etwa folgendes schreibt: ›Euch Dilettanten muß man schelten, denn es finden bei euch gewöhnlich zwei Dinge statt: entweder ihr habt keine eigene Gedanken, und da nehmet ihr fremde; oder wenn ihr eigene Gedanken habt, so wißt ihr nicht damit umzugehen.‹ Ist das nicht himmlisch? Und gilt dieses große Wort, was Mozart von der Musik sagt, nicht von allen übrigen Künsten?« Goethe fuhr fort: »Lenardo da Vinci sagt: ›Wenn in euerm Sohn nicht der Sinn steckt, dasjenige, was er zeichnet, durch kräftige Schattierung so herauszuheben, daß man es mit Händen greifen möchte, so hat er kein Talent.‹ Und ferner sagt Lenardo da Vinci: ›Wenn euer Sohn Perspektive und Anatomie völlig innehat, so tut ihn zu einem guten Meister.‹ Und jetzt«, sagte Goethe, »verstehen unsere jungen Künstler beides kaum, wenn sie ihre Meister verlassen. So sehr haben sich die Zeiten geändert. Unsern jungen Malern«, fuhr Goethe fort, »fehlt es an Gemüt und Geist; ihre Erfindungen sagen nichts und wirken nichts; sie malen Schwerter, die nicht hauen, und Pfeile, die nicht treffen, und es dringt sich mir oft auf, als wäre aller Geist aus der Welt verschwunden.« »Und doch«, versetzte ich, »sollte man glauben, daß die großen kriegerischen Ereignisse der letzten Jahre den Geist aufgeregt hätten.« »Mehr Wollen«, sagte Goethe, »haben sie aufgeregt als Geist, und mehr politischen Geist als künstlerischen, und alle Naivetät und Sinnlichkeit ist dagegen gänzlich verloren gegangen. Wie will aber ein Maler ohne diese beiden großen Erfordernisse etwas machen, woran man Freude haben könnte.« Ich sagte, daß ich dieser Tage in

welches eine Entwöhnung darstellt, wo das Kind Christus auf dem Schoße der Maria zwischen der Mutterbrust und einer hingereichten Birne in Zweifel kommt und nicht weiß, welches von beiden es wählen soll. »Ja«, sagte Goethe, »das ist ein Bildchen! Da ist Geist, Naivetät, Sinnlichkeit, alles beieinander. Und der heilige Gegenstand ist allgemein menschlich geworden und gilt als Symbol für eine Lebensstufe, die wir alle durchmachen. Ein solches Bild ist ewig, weil es in die frühesten Zeiten der Menschheit zurück- und in die künftigsten vorwärtsgreift. Wollte man dagegen den Christus malen, wie er die Kindlein zu sich kommen läßt, so wäre das ein Bild, welches gar nichts zu sagen hätte, wenigstens nichts von Bedeutung.

Ich habe nun«, fuhr Goethe fort, »der deutschen Malerei über funfzig Jahre zugesehen, ja nicht bloß zugesehen, sondern auch von meiner Seite einzuwirken gesucht, und kann jetzt so viel sagen, daß, so wie alles jetzt steht, wenig zu erwarten ist. Es muß ein großes Talent kommen, welches sich alles Gute der Zeit sogleich aneignet und dadurch alles übertrifft. Die Mittel sind alle da, und die Wege gezeigt und gebahnt. Haben wir doch jetzt sogar auch die Phidiasse vor Augen, woran in unserer Jugend nicht zu denken war. Es fehlt jetzt, wie gesagt, weiter nichts als ein großes Talent, und dieses, hoffe ich, wird kommen; es liegt vielleicht schon in der Wiege, und Sie können seinen Glanz noch erleben.«

Es mochte etwa vier Uhr sein; es war ein bedeckter Himmel und im ersten Anfangen der Dämmerung. Goethe zündete ein Licht an und ging damit in die Nähe des Fensters zu einem Tische. Er setzte das Licht auf einen weißen Bogen Papier und stellte ein Stäbchen darauf, so daß der Schein des Kerzenlichtes vom Stäbchen aus einen Schatten warf nach dem Lichte des Tages zu. »Nun,« sagte Goethe, »was sagen Sie zu diesem Schatten?« – »Der Schatten ist blau«, antwortete ich. – »Da hätten Sie also das Blaue wieder,« sagte Goethe; »aber auf dieser andern Seite des Stäbchens nach der Kerze zu, was sehen Sie da – »Auch einen Schatten.« – »Aber von welcher Farbe?« »Der Schatten ist ein rötliches Gelb,« antwortete ich; »doch wie entsteht dieses doppelte Phänomen?« – »Das ist nun Ihre Sache,« sagte Goethe; »sehen Sie zu, daß Sie es herausbringen. Zu finden ist es, aber es ist schwer. Sehen Sie nicht früher in meiner ›Farbenlehre‹ nach, als bis Sie die Hoffnung aufgegeben haben, es selber herauszubringen.«

Ich hatte meine Freude an dem Phänomen. »Ja,« sagte Goethe, »das ist eben das Große bei der Natur, daß sie so einfach ist und daß sie ihre größten Erscheinungen immer im Kleinen wiederholt. Dasselbe Gesetz, wodurch der Himmel blau ist, sieht man ebenfalls an dem untern Teil einer brennenden Kerze, am brennenden Spiritus sowie an dem erleuchteten Rauch, der von einem Dorfe aufsteigt, hinter welchem ein dunkles Gebirge liegt.« »Aber wie erklären die Schüler von Newton dieses höchst einfache Phänomen?« fragte ich. »Das müssen Sie gar nicht wissen«, antwortete Goethe. »Es ist gar zu dumm, und man glaubt nicht, welchen Schaden es einem guten Kopfe tut, wenn er sich mit etwas Dummen befaßt. Bekümmern Sie sich gar nicht um die Newtonianer, lassen Sie sich die reine Lehre genügen, und Sie werden sich gut dabei stehen.«

»Es ist nur gut,« sagte ich, »daß Sie ein so ausführliches Schema haben.« – »Das Schema ist wohl da«, sagte Goethe, »allein das Schwierigste ist noch zu tun; und bei der Ausführung hängt doch alles gar zu sehr vom Glück ab. Die ›Klassische Walpurgisnacht‹ muß in Reimen geschrieben werden, und doch muß alles einen antiken Charakter tragen. Eine solche Versart zu finden ist nicht leicht. Und nun den Dialog!« – »Ist denn der nicht im Schema mit erfunden?« sagte ich. »Wohl das Was,« antwortete Goethe, »aber nicht das Wie. Und dann bedenken Sie nur, was alles in jener tollen Nacht zur Sprache kommt! Fausts Rede an die Proserpina, um diese zu bewegen, daß sie die Helena herausgibt; was muß das nicht für eine Rede sein, da die Proserpina selbst zu Tränen davon gerührt wird! – Dieses alles ist nicht leicht zu machen und hängt sehr viel vom Glück ab, ja fast ganz von der Stimmung und Kraft des Augenblicks.«

Nun fehlte es uns aber an Stücken, und wir hätten gerne jene drei gewaltsamen Erstlinge dem Repertoire gewonnen. Es wollte aber nicht gehen, es war alles zu sehr miteinander verwachsen, so daß Schiller selbst an dem Unternehmen verzweifelte und sich genötigt sah, seinen Vorsatz aufzugeben und die Stücke zu lassen, wie sie waren.« »Es ist schade darum«, sagte ich; »denn trotz aller Roheiten sind sie mir doch tausendmal lieber als die schwachen, weichen, forcierten und unnatürlichen Stücke einiger unserer neuesten Tragiker.

Was ein junger Mensch geschrieben hat, wird auch wieder am besten von jungen Leuten genossen werden. Und dann denke man nicht, daß die Welt so sehr in der Kultur und gutem Geschmack vorschritte, daß selbst die Jugend schon über eine solche rohere Epoche hinaus wäre! Wenn auch die Welt im ganzen vorschreitet, die Jugend muß doch immer wieder von vorne anfangen und als Individuum die Epochen der Weltkultur durchmachen. Mich irritiert das nicht mehr, und ich habe längst einen Vers darauf gemacht, der so lautet: Johannisfeuer sei unverwehrt, Die Freude nie verloren! Besen werden immer stumpf gekehrt Und Jungens immer geboren. Ich brauche nur zum Fenster hinauszusehen, um in straßenkehrenden Besen und herumlaufenden Kindern die Symbole der sich ewig abnutzenden und immer sich verjüngenden Welt beständig vor Augen zu haben. Kinderspiele und Jugendvergnügungen erhalten sich daher und pflanzen sich von Jahrhundert zu Jahrhundert fort; denn so absurd sie auch einem reiferen Alter erscheinen mögen, Kinder bleiben doch immer Kinder und sind sich zu allen Zeiten ähnlich. Deshalb soll man auch die Johannisfeuer nicht verbieten und den lieben Kindern die Freude daran nicht verderben.« Unter solchen und ähnlichen

Reid likes to point out false choices. For example, some ask if entrepreneurs should set plans or just be ready to adapt. False choice, Reid says: they need to do both. Should you have a small number of intimate friends or a large number of looser ties? Both. Indeed, one of Reid’s favorite quotes is from the great Jewish sage Hillel: “If I am not for myself, who is? And when I am for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?” One interpretation of the quote is that you must love yourself and yet you ought not to live just for your benefit. You should help others, too. Reject choosing between self-love and love of others: do both. So I’d agree that the macro correct answer

But if I go for a blended reason, I’ll almost surely come back and feel like it was a waste a time.” He did not go on the trip. If you come up with a list of many reasons to do something, Nassim Taleb once wrote, you are trying to convince yourself—if there isn’t one clear reason, don’t do it.

You know it if they don’t just accept the strategy you hand them. They should suggest modifications to the plan based on their closeness to the details.

Don’t annoy your readers by over-explaining - by telling them something they already know or can figure out.

The most untaught and underestimated skill in nonfiction writing is how to organize a long article: how to put the jigsaw puzzle together. Nobody can write a decent article about the disappearance of small towns in Iowa; it would be all generalization and no humanity. The writer would have to write about one small town in Iowa and thereby tell her larger story. And even within that one town she would have to reduce her story still further: to one store, or one family, or one farmer.

I just went to Toys “R” Us and walked the aisles. I looked at what was on the shelves and tried to imagine ways to make a small change that would have a big impact. My shopping excursions only planted the seed of an idea. I had to do more market research to germinate that idea: to figure out how to design it, how much it should cost, who might license it, and so on. Discover hot markets and emerging trends. Check out websites such as Trendsetter.com and MindBranch.com Look at new products, and ask store managers which items are hot. There are usually three or four big companies that produce most of the products in a given market.

Recursive here means that the world in which we live has an increasing number of feedback loops, causing events to be the cause of more events (say, people buy a book because other people bought it), thus generating snowballs and arbitrary and unpredictable planet-wide winner-take-all effects. We live in an environment where information flows too rapidly, accelerating such epidemics. Likewise, events can happen because they are not supposed to happen. (Our intuitions are made for an environment with simpler causes and effects and slowly moving information.) This type of randomness did not prevail during the Pleistocene, as socioeconomic life was far simpler then.

I was in a basement with history audibly unfolding above me (the sound of mortar shells kept me up all night). I was a teenager attending the funerals of classmates. I was experiencing a nontheoretical unfolding of History and I was reading about someone apparently experiencing history as it went along. I made efforts to mentally produce a movielike representation of the future and realized it was not so obvious. I realized that if I were to start writing about the events later they would seem more … historical. There was a difference between the before and the after.

Categorizing is necessary for humans, but it becomes pathological when the category is seen as definitive, preventing people from considering the fuzziness of boundaries, let alone revising their categories. Contagion was the culprit. If you selected one hundred independent-minded journalists capable of seeing factors in isolation from one another, you would get one hundred different opinions. But the process of having these people report in lockstep caused the dimensionality of the opinion set to shrink considerably—they converged on opinions and used the same items as causes.

In Extremistan, inequalities are such that one single observation can disproportionately impact the aggregate, or the total. So while weight, height, and calorie consumption are from Mediocristan, wealth is not. Almost all social matters are from Extremistan. Another way to say it is that social quantities are informational, not physical: you cannot touch them. Money in a bank account is something important, but certainly not physical. As such it can take any value without necessitating the expenditure of energy.

Ferguson used a clever empirical argument to make his point: he looked at the prices of imperial bonds, which normally include investors’ anticipation of government’s financing needs and decline in expectation of conflicts since wars cause severe deficits. But bond prices did not reflect the anticipation of war. Note that this study illustrates, in addition, how working with prices can provide a good understanding of history.

She was told, “You need to understand who your audience is” and “amateurs write for themselves, professionals write for others.” She was also told to conform to a precise genre because “bookstores do not like to be confused and need to know where to place a book on the shelves.” One editor protectively added, “This, my dear friend, will only sell ten copies, including those bought by your ex-husbands and family members.” She had attended a famous writing workshop five years earlier and came out nauseated. “Writing well” seemed to mean obeying arbitrary rules that had grown into gospel, with the confirmatory reinforcement of what we call “experience.” The writers she met were learning to retrofit what was deemed successful: they all tried to imitate stories that had appeared in past issues of The New Yorker—not realizing that most of what is new, by definition, cannot be modeled on past issues of The New Yorker.

If the advice was helpful, and it was, in creating a classification for ranking uncertainty and knowledge, it was a mistake as far as choices of profession went. It might have paid off for me, but only because I was lucky and happened to be “in the right place at the right time,” as the saying goes. If I myself had to give advice, I would recommend someone pick a profession that is not scalable! A scalable profession is good only if you are successful; they are more competitive, produce monstrous inequalities, and are far more random, with huge disparities between efforts and rewards—a few can take a large share of the pie, leaving others out entirely at no fault of their own.

Whenever you hear a snotty (and frustrated) European middlebrow presenting his stereotypes about Americans, he will often describe them as “uncultured,” “unintellectual,” and “poor in math” because, unlike his peers, Americans are not into equation drills and the constructions middlebrows call “high culture”—like knowledge of Goethe’s inspirational (and central) trip to Italy, or familiarity with the Delft school of painting. Yet the person making these statements is likely to be addicted to his iPod, wear blue jeans, and use Microsoft Word to jot down his “cultural” statements on his PC, with some Google searches here and there interrupting his composition. Well, it so happens that America is currently far, far more creative than these nations of museumgoers and equation solvers. It is also far more tolerant of bottom-up tinkering and undirected trial and error. And globalization has allowed the United States to specialize in the creative aspect of things, the production of concepts and ideas, that is, the scalable part of the products, and, increasingly, by exporting jobs, separate the less scalable components and assign them to those happy to be paid by the hour. There is more money in designing a shoe than in actually making it: Nike, Dell, and Boeing can get paid for just thinking, organizing, and leveraging their know-how and ideas while subcontracted factories in developing countries do the grunt work and engineers in cultured and mathematical states do the noncreative technical grind.

Inductive Knowledge (capitalized for its seriousness)—certainly the mother of all problems in life. How can we logically go from specific instances to reach general conclusions? How do we know what we know? How do we know that what we have observed from given objects and events suffices to enable us to figure out their other properties? There are traps built into any kind of knowledge gained from observation.

The human mind suffers from three ailments as it comes into contact with history, what I call the triplet of opacity. They are: the illusion of understanding, or how everyone thinks he knows what is going on in a world that is more complicated (or random) than they realize; the retrospective distortion, or how we can assess matters only after the fact, as if they were in a rearview mirror (history seems clearer and more organized in history books than in empirical reality); and the overvaluation of factual information and the handicap of authoritative and learned people, particularly when they create categories—when they “Platonify.”

CLUSTERS I also noticed during the Lebanese war that journalists tended to cluster not necessarily around the same opinions but frequently around the same framework of analyses. They assign the same importance to the same sets of circumstances and cut reality into the same categories—once again the manifestation of Platonicity, the desire to cut reality into crisp shapes. What Robert Fisk calls “hotel journalism” further increased the mental contagion.

Categorizing always produces reduction in true complexity. It is a manifestation of the Black Swan generator, that unshakable Platonicity that I defined in the Prologue. Any reduction of the world around us can have explosive consequences since it rules out some sources of uncertainty; it drives us to a misunderstanding of the fabric of the world. For instance, you may think that radical Islam (and its values) are your allies against the threat of Communism, and so you may help them develop, until they send two planes into downtown Manhattan.

Now, there are other themes arising from our blindness to the Black Swan: We focus on preselected segments of the seen and generalize from it to the unseen: the error of confirmation. We fool ourselves with stories that cater to our Platonic thirst for distinct patterns: the narrative fallacy. We behave as if the Black Swan does not exist: human nature is not programmed for Black Swans. What we see is not necessarily all that is there. History hides Black Swans from us and gives us a mistaken idea about the odds of these events: this is the distortion of silent evidence. We “tunnel”: that is, we focus on a few well-defined sources of uncertainty, on too specific a list of Black Swans (at the expense of the others that do not easily come to mind).

Let us call it the domain specificity of our reactions. By domain-specific I mean that our reactions, our mode of thinking, our intuitions, depend on the context in which the matter is presented, what evolutionary psychologists call the “domain” of the object or the event. The classroom is a domain; real life is another. We react to a piece of information not on its logical merit, but on the basis of which framework surrounds it, and how it registers with our social-emotional system. Logical problems approached one way in the classroom might be treated differently in daily life. Indeed they are treated differently in daily life. Knowledge, even when it is exact, does not often lead to appropriate actions because we tend to forget what we know, or forget how to process it properly if we do not pay attention, even when we are experts. Statisticians, it has been shown, tend to leave their brains in the classroom and engage in the most trivial inferential errors once they are let out on the streets. In 1971, the psychologists Danny Kahneman and Amos Tversky plied professors of statistics with statistical questions not phrased as statistical questions. One was similar to the following (changing the example for clarity): Assume that you live in a town with two hospitals—one large, the other small. On a given day 60 percent of those born in one of the two hospitals are boys. Which hospital is it likely to be? Many statisticians made the equivalent of the mistake (during a casual conversation) of choosing the larger hospital, when in fact the very basis of statistics is that large samples are more stable and should fluctuate less from the long-term average—here, 50 percent for each of the sexes—than smaller samples.

People can manage to effortlessly solve a problem in a social situation but struggle when it is presented as an abstract logical problem. We tend to use different mental machinery—so-called modules—in different situations: our brain lacks a central all-purpose computer that starts with logical rules and applies them equally to all possible situations. And as I’ve said, we can commit a logical mistake in reality but not in the classroom.

Doctors in the midst of the scientific arrogance of the 1960s looked down at mothers’ milk as something primitive, as if it could be replicated by their laboratories—not realizing that mothers’ milk might include useful components that could have eluded their scientific understanding—a simple confusion of absence of evidence of the benefits of mothers’ milk with evidence of absence of the benefits (another case of Platonicity as “it did not make sense” to breast-feed when we could simply use bottles).

The problem of narrativity, although extensively studied in one of its versions by psychologists, is not so “psychological”: something about the way disciplines are designed masks the point that it is more generally a problem of information.

Elders are repositories of complicated inductive learning that includes information about rare events. Elders can scare us with stories—which is why we become overexcited when we think of a specific Black Swan. I was excited to find out that this also holds true in the animal kingdom: a paper in Science showed that elephant matriarchs play the role of superadvisers on rare events. We learn

intelligence—we humans have the largest cortex, followed by bank executives, dolphins, and our cousins the apes. Well, it turns out that some birds, such as parrots, have a high level of intelligence, equivalent to that of dolphins, but that the intelligence of birds correlates with the size of another part of the brain, called the hyperstriatum. So neurobiology with its attribute of “hard science” can sometimes (though not always) fool you into a Platonified, reductive statement. I am amazed that the “empirics,” skeptical about links between anatomy and function, had such insight—no wonder their school played a very small part in intellectual history. As a skeptical empiricist I prefer the experiments of empirical psychology to the theories-based MRI scans of neurobiologists, even if the former appear less “scientific” to the public.

The way to avoid the ills of the narrative fallacy is to favor experimentation over storytelling, experience over history, and clinical knowledge over theories. Certainly the newspaper cannot perform an experiment, but it can choose one report over another—there is plenty of empirical research to present and interpret from—as I am doing in this book. Being empirical does not mean running a laboratory in one’s basement: it is just a mind-set that favors a certain class of knowledge over others.

For Yevgenia Krasnova, a person could love one book, at most a few—beyond this was a form of promiscuity. Those who talk about books as commodities are inauthentic, just as those who collect acquaintances can be superficial in their friendships. A novel you like resembles a friend. You read it and reread it, getting to know it better. Like a friend, you accept it the way it is; you do not judge it. Montaigne was asked “why” he and the writer Etienne de la Boétie were friends—the kind of question people ask you at a cocktail party as if you knew the answer, or as if there were an answer to know. It was typical of Montaigne to reply, “Parce que c’était lui, parce que c’était moi” (because it was him and because it was me).

So one day early in his career, Nero sat down and listened very calmly to the evaluation of his “supervisor.” When Nero was handed the evaluation form he tore it into small pieces in front of him. He did this very slowly, accentuating the contrast between the nature of the act and the tranquillity with which he tore the paper. The boss watched him blank with fear, eyes popping out of his head.

How to Become a Millionaire in Ten Steps Numerous studies of millionaires aimed at figuring out the skills required for hotshotness follow the following methodology. They take a population of hotshots, those with big titles and big jobs, and study their attributes. They look at what those big guns have in common: courage, risk taking, optimism, and so on, and infer that these traits, most notably risk taking, help you to become successful. You would also probably get the same impression if you read CEOs’ ghostwritten autobiographies or attended their presentations to fawning MBA students. Now take a look at the cemetery. It is quite difficult to do so because people who fail do not seem to write memoirs, and, if they did, those business publishers I know would not even consider giving them the courtesy of a returned phone call (as to returned e-mail, fuhgedit). Readers would not pay $26.95 for a story of failure, even if you convinced them that it had more useful tricks than a story of success.

The graveyard of failed persons will be full of people who shared the following traits: courage, risk taking, optimism, et cetera. Just like the population of millionaires. There may be some differences in skills, but what truly separates the two is for the most part a single factor: luck. Plain luck.

Owing to the invisibility of the dead rats, the more lethal the risks, the less visible they will be, since the severely victimized are likely to be eliminated from the evidence. The more injurious the treatment, the larger the difference between the surviving rats and the rest, and the more fooled you will be about the strengthening effect. One of the two following ingredients is necessary for this difference between the true effect (weakening) and the observed one (strengthening): a) a degree of inequality in strength, or diversity, in the base cohort, or b) unevenness, or diversity, somewhere in the treatment. Diversity here has to do with the degree of uncertainty inherent in the process.

The stability of species. Take the number of species that we now consider extinct. For a long time scientists took the number of such species as that implied from an analysis of the extant fossils. But this number ignores the silent cemetery of species that came and left without leaving traces in the form of fossils; the fossils that we have managed to find correspond to a smaller proportion of all species that came and disappeared. This implies that our biodiversity was far greater than it seemed at first examination. A more worrisome consequence is that the rate of extinction of species may be far greater than we think—close to 99.5 percent of species that transited through earth are now extinct, a number that scientists have kept raising through time. Life is a great deal more fragile than we have allowed

In addition, our representation of the standard criminal might be based on the properties of those less intelligent ones who were caught. Once we seep ourselves into the notion of silent evidence, so many things around us that were previously hidden start manifesting themselves.

But often an action’s positive consequences benefit only its author, since they are visible, while the negative consequences, being invisible, apply to others, with a net cost to society. Consider job-protection measures: you notice those whose jobs are made safe and ascribe social benefits to such protections. You do not notice the effect on those who cannot find a job as a result, since the measure will reduce job openings. In some cases, as with the cancer patients who may be punished by Katrina, the positive consequences of an action will immediately benefit the politicians and phony humanitarians, while the negative ones take a long time to appear—they may never become noticeable. One can even blame the press for directing charitable contributions toward those who may need them the least.

As I wrote, missing a train is only painful if you are running after it. I was not looking to have a bestseller (I thought I had already had one with my previous book, and just wanted to produce a real thing), so I had to deal with a spate of harrying side effects. I watched as the book was initially treated, owing to its bestseller status, like the nonfiction “idea books,” journalistic through and through, castrated by a thorough and “competent” copy editor, and sold in airports to “thinking” businessmen. Giving these enlightened Bildungsphilisters, commonly called idea-book readers, a real book is like giving vintage Bordeaux to drinkers of Diet Coke and listening to their comments about it.

Man spricht immer viel von Aristokratie und Demokratie, die Sache ist ganz einfach diese: In der Jugend, wo wir nichts besitzen oder doch den ruhigen Besitz nicht zu schätzen wissen, sind wir Demokraten; sind wir aber in einem langen Leben zu Eigentum gekommen, so wünschen wir dieses nicht allein gesichert, sondern wir wünschen auch, daß unsere Kinder und Enkel das Erworbene ruhig genießen mögen. Deshalb sind wir im Alter immer Aristokraten ohne Ausnahme, wenn wir auch in der Jugend uns zu anderen Gesinnungen hinneigten. Leo spricht über diesen Punkt mit großem Geiste.

Schiller erscheint hier, wie immer, im absoluten Besitz seiner erhabenen Natur; er ist so groß am Teetisch, wie er es im Staatsrat gewesen sein würde. Nichts geniert ihn, nichts engt ihn ein, nichts zieht den Flug seiner Gedanken herab; was in ihm von großen Ansichten lebt, geht immer frei heraus ohne Rücksicht und ohne Bedenken. Das war ein rechter Mensch, und so sollte man auch sein! – Wir andern dagegen fühlen uns immer bedingt; die Personen, die Gegenstände, die uns umgeben, haben auf uns ihren Einfluß; der Teelöffel geniert uns, wenn er von Gold ist, da er von Silber sein sollte, und so, durch tausend Rücksichten paralysiert, kommen wir nicht dazu, was etwa Großes in unserer Natur sein möchte, frei auszulassen. Wir sind die Sklaven der Gegenstände und erscheinen geringe oder bedeutend, je nachdem uns diese zusammenziehen oder zu freier Ausdehnung Raum geben.« Goethe schwieg, das Gespräch mischte sich anders; ich aber bedachte diese merkwürdigen, auch mein eigenes Innere berührenden und aussprechenden Worte in meinem Herzen.

»Liebes Kind,« sagte er, »ich will Ihnen etwas vertrauen, das Sie sogleich über vieles hinaushelfen und das Ihnen lebenslänglich zugute kommen soll. Meine Sachen können nicht popular werden; wer daran denkt und dafür strebt, ist in einem Irrtum. Sie sind nicht für die Masse geschrieben, sondern nur für einzelne Menschen, die etwas Ähnliches wollen und suchen und die in ähnlichen Richtungen begriffen sind.« Er wollte weiterreden; eine junge Dame trat heran, ihn unterbrechend und ihn in ein Gespräch ziehend. Ich wendete mich zu anderen, worauf wir uns bald zu Tisch setzten. Von dem, was gesprochen wurde, wüßte ich nichts zu sagen; Goethes Worte lagen mir im Sinn und beschäftigten ganz mein Inneres. Freilich, dachte ich, ein Schriftsteller wie er, ein Geist von solcher Höhe, eine Natur von so unendlichem Umfang, wie soll der popular werden! Kann doch kaum ein kleiner Teil von ihm popular werden! Kaum ein Lied, das lustige Brüder und verliebte Mädchen singen und das für andere wiederum nicht da ist! Und, recht besehen, ist es nicht mit allen außerordentlichen Dingen so? Ist denn Mozart popular? Und ist es denn Raffael? Und verhält sich nicht die Welt gegen so große Quellen überschwenglichen geistigen Lebens überall nur wie Naschende, die froh sind, hin und wieder ein weniges zu erhaschen, das ihnen eine Weile eine höhere Nahrung gewähre? Ja, fuhr ich in meinen Gedanken fort, Goethe hat recht. Er kann seinem Umfange nach nicht popular werden, und seine Werke sind nur für einzelne Menschen, die etwas Ähnliches suchen und die in ähnlichen Richtungen begriffen sind. Sie sind im ganzen für betrachtende Naturen, die in die Tiefen der Welt und Menschheit zu dringen wünschen und seinen Pfaden nachgehen. Sie sind im einzelnen für leidenschaftlich Genießende, die des Herzens Wonne und Weh im Dichter suchen. Sie sind für junge Poeten, die lernen wollen, wie man sich ausdrücke und wie man einen Gegenstand kunstgemäß behandele. Sie sind für Kritiker, die darin ein Muster empfangen, nach welchen Maximen man urteilen solle, und wie man auch eine Rezension interessant und anmutig mache, so daß man sie mit Freuden lese. Seine Werke sind für den Künstler, weil sie ihm im allgemeinen den Geist aufklären und er im besonderen aus ihnen lernt, welche Gegenstände eine kunstgemäße Bedeutung haben, und was er demnach darstellen solle und was nicht. Sie sind für den Naturforscher, nicht allein, weil gefundene große Gesetze ihm überliefert werden, sondern auch vorzüglich, weil er darin eine Methode empfängt, wie ein guter Geist mit der Natur verfahren müsse, damit sie ihm ihre Geheimnisse offenbare.

Robert Trivers, an evolutionary psychologist and a man of supernormal insights, has another answer (he became one of the most influential evolutionary thinkers since Darwin with ideas he developed while trying to go to law school). He links it to self-deception. In fields where we have ancestral traditions, such as pillaging, we are very good at predicting outcomes by gauging the balance of power. Humans and chimps can immediately sense which side has the upper hand, and make a cost-benefit analysis about whether to attack and take the goods and the mates. Once you start raiding, you put yourself into a delusional mind-set that makes you ignore additional information—it is best to avoid wavering during battle. On the other hand, unlike raids, large-scale wars are not something present in human heritage—we are new to them—so we tend to misestimate their duration and overestimate our relative power. Recall the underestimation of the duration of the Lebanese war. Those who fought in the Great War thought it would be a mere cakewalk. So it was with the Vietnam conflict, so it is with the Iraq war, and just about every modern conflict.

Prediction requires knowing about technologies that will be discovered in the future. But that very knowledge would almost automatically allow us to start developing those technologies right away. Ergo, we do not know what we will know.

Poincaré became a prolific essayist in his thirties. He seemed in a hurry and died prematurely, at fifty-eight; he was in such a rush that he did not bother correcting typos and grammatical errors in his text, even after spotting them, since he found doing so a gross misuse of his time. They no longer make geniuses like that—or they no longer let them write in their own way.

Poincaré’s reasoning was simple: as you project into the future you may need an increasing amount of precision about the dynamics of the process that you are modeling, since your error rate grows very rapidly. The problem is that near precision is not possible since the degradation of your forecast compounds abruptly—you would eventually need to figure out the past with infinite precision. Poincaré showed this in a very simple case, famously known as the “three body problem.” If you have only two planets in a solar-style system, with nothing else affecting their course, then you may be able to indefinitely predict the behavior of these planets, no sweat. But add a third body, say a comet, ever so small, between the planets. Initially the third body will cause no drift, no impact; later, with time, its effects on the two other bodies may become explosive. Small differences in where this tiny body is located will eventually dictate the future of the behemoth planets.

Lorenz subsequently realized that the consequential divergence in his results arose not from error, but from a small rounding in the input parameters. This became known as the butterfly effect, since a butterfly moving its wings in India could cause a hurricane in New York, two years later. Lorenz’s findings generated interest in the field of chaos theory.

In reality, languages grow organically; grammar is something people without anything more exciting to do in their lives codify into a book. While the scholastic-minded will memorize declensions, the a-Platonic nonnerd will acquire, say, Serbo-Croatian by picking up potential girlfriends in bars on the outskirts of Sarajevo, or talking to cabdrivers, then fitting (if needed) grammatical rules to the knowledge he already possesses. Consider again the central planner. As with language, there is no grammatical authority codifying social and economic events; but try to convince a bureaucrat or social scientist that the world might not want to follow his “scientific” equations.

Ordinary Roman carts were constructed to match the width of imperial Roman war chariots because it was easier to follow the ruts in the road left by the war chariots. The chariots were sized to accommodate the width of two large warhorses, which translates into our English measurement of 4’ 8.5”. Roads throughout the vast Roman Empire were built to this specification. When the legions of Rome marched into Britain, they constructed long-distance imperial roads 4’ 8.5” wide. When the English started building tramways, they used the same width so the same horse carriages could be used. And when they started building railways with horseless carriages, naturally the rails were 4’ 8.5” wide. Imported laborers from the British Isles built the first railways in the Americas using the same tools and jigs they were used to. Fast-forward to the U.S. space shuttle, which is built in parts around the country and assembled in Florida. Because the two large solid-fuel rocket engines on the side of the launch shuttle were sent by railroad from Utah, and that line traversed a tunnel not much wider than the standard track, the rockets themselves could not be much wider in diameter than 4’ 8.5”.

»Man hat zu allen Zeiten gesagt und wiederholt,« fuhr Goethe fort, »man solle trachten, sich selber zu kennen. Dies ist eine seltsame Forderung, der bis jetzt niemand genüget hat und der eigentlich auch niemand genügen soll. Der Mensch ist mit allem seinem Sinnen und Trachten aufs Äußere angewiesen, auf die Welt um ihn her, und er hat zu tun, diese insoweit zu kennen und sich insoweit dienstbar zu machen, als er es zu seinen Zwecken bedarf. Von sich selber weiß er bloß, wenn er genießt oder leidet, und so wird er auch bloß durch Leiden und Freuden über sich belehrt, was er zu suchen oder zu meiden hat. Übrigens aber ist der Mensch ein dunkeles Wesen, er weiß nicht, woher er kommt noch wohin er geht, er weiß wenig von der Welt und am wenigsten von sich selber. Ich kenne mich auch nicht, und Gott soll mich auch davor behüten. Was ich aber sagen wollte, ist dieses, daß ich in Italien in meinem vierzigsten Jahre klug genug war, um mich selber insoweit zu kennen, daß ich kein Talent zur bildenden Kunst habe, und daß diese meine Tendenz eine falsche sei. Wenn ich etwas zeichnete, so fehlte es mir an genugsamem Trieb für das Körperliche; ich hatte eine gewisse Furcht, die Gegenstände auf mich eindringend zu machen, vielmehr war das Schwächere, das Mäßige nach meinem Sinn. Machte ich eine Landschaft und kam ich aus den schwachen Fernen durch die Mittelgründe heran, so fürchtete ich immer, dem Vordergrund die gehörige Kraft zu geben, und so tat denn mein Bild nie die rechte Wirkung. Auch machte ich keine Fortschritte, ohne mich zu üben, und ich mußte immer wieder von vorne anfangen, wenn ich eine Zeitlang ausgesetzt hatte. Ganz ohne Talent war ich jedoch nicht, besonders zu Landschaften, und Hackert sagte sehr oft: ›Wenn Sie achtzehn Monate bei mir bleiben wollen, so sollen Sie etwas machen, woran Sie und andere Freude haben.‹« Ich hörte dieses mit großem Interesse. »Wie aber«, sagte ich, »soll man erkennen, daß einer zur bildenden Kunst ein wahrhaftes Talent habe?« »Das wirkliche Talent«, sagte Goethe, »besitzt einen angeborenen Sinn für die Gestalt, die Verhältnisse und die Farbe, so daß es alles dieses unter weniger Anleitung sehr bald und richtig macht. Besonders hat es den Sinn für das Körperliche, und den Trieb, es durch die Beleuchtung handgreiflich zu machen. Auch in den Zwischenpausen der Übung schreitet es fort und wächst im Innern. Ein solches Talent ist nicht schwer zu erkennen, am besten aber erkennt es der Meister.

weitere Produktion noch munter fortwächst. Das Schlimme ist,« fuhr Goethe fort, »daß man im Leben so viel durch falsche Tendenzen ist gehindert worden und daß man nie eine solche Tendenz erkannt, als bis man sich bereits schon frei gemacht.« »Woran aber«, sagte ich, »soll man sehen und wissen, daß eine Tendenz eine falsche sei?« »Die falsche Tendenz«, antwortete Goethe, »ist nicht produktiv, und wenn sie es ist, so ist das Hervorgebrachte von keinem Wert. Dieses an andern gewahr zu werden, ist nicht so gar schwer, aber an sich selber, ist ein eigenes Ding und will eine große Freiheit des Geistes. Und selbst das Erkennen hilft nicht immer; man zaudert und zweifelt und kann sich nicht entschließen, so wie es schwer hält, sich von einem geliebten Mädchen loszumachen, von deren Untreue man längst wiederholte Beweise hat. Ich sage dieses, indem ich bedenke, wie viele Jahre es gebrauchte, bis ich einsah, daß meine Tendenz zur bildenden Kunst eine falsche sei, und wie viele andere, nachdem ich es erkannt, mich davon loszumachen.« »Aber doch«, sagte ich, »hat Ihnen diese Tendenz so vielen Vorteil gebracht, daß man sie kaum eine falsche nennen möchte.« »Ich habe an Einsicht gewonnen,« sagte Goethe, »weshalb ich mich auch darüber beruhigen kann. Und das ist der Vorteil, den wir aus jeder falschen Tendenz ziehen. Wer mit unzulänglichem Talent sich in der Musik bemühet, wird freilich nie ein Meister werden, aber er wird dabei lernen, dasjenige zu erkennen und zu schätzen, was der Meister gemacht hat. Trotz aller meiner Bestrebungen bin ich freilich kein Künstler geworden, aber indem ich mich in allen Teilen der Kunst versuchte, habe ich gelernt, von jedem Strich Rechenschaft zu geben und das Verdienstliche vom Mangelhaften zu unterscheiden. Dieses ist kein kleiner Gewinn, so wie denn selten eine falsche Tendenz ohne Gewinn bleibt. So z. B. waren die Kreuzzüge zur Befreiung des Heiligen Grabes offenbar eine falsche Tendenz; aber sie hat das Gute gehabt, daß dadurch die Türken immerfort geschwächt und gehindert worden sind, sich zu Herren von Europa zu machen.«

»Da die Konzeption so alt ist«, sagte Goethe, »und ich seit funfzig Jahren darüber nachdenke, so hat sich das innere Material so sehr gehäuft, daß jetzt das Ausscheiden und Ablehnen die schwere Operation ist. Die Erfindung des ganzen zweiten Teiles ist wirklich so alt, wie ich sage. Aber daß ich ihn erst jetzt schreibe, nachdem ich über die weltlichen Dinge so viel klarer geworden, mag der Sache zugute kommen. Es geht mir damit wie einem, der in seiner Jugend sehr viel kleines Silber- und Kupfergeld hat, das er während dem Lauf seines Lebens immer bedeutender einwechselt, so daß er zuletzt seinen Jugendbesitz in reinen Goldstücken vor sich sieht.«

So kann ich mich des Gedankens nicht erwehren, daß die Dämonen, um die Menschheit zu necken und zum besten zu haben, mitunter einzelne Figuren hinstellen, die so anlockend sind, daß jeder nach ihnen strebt, und so groß, daß niemand sie erreicht. So stellten sie den Raffael hin, bei dem Denken und Tun gleich vollkommen war; einzelne treffliche Nachkommen haben sich ihm genähert, aber erreicht hat ihn niemand. So stellten sie den Mozart hin als etwas Unerreichbares in der Musik. Und so in der Poesie Shakespeare.

Ideas for startups are worth something, certainly, but the trouble is, they're not transferrable. They're not something you could hand to someone else to execute. Their value is mainly as starting points: as questions for the people who had them to continue thinking about. What matters is not ideas, but the people who have them. Good people can fix bad ideas, but good ideas can't save bad people.

When most people think of startups, they think of companies like Apple or Google. Everyone knows these, because they're big consumer brands. But for every startup like that, there are twenty more that operate in niche markets or live quietly down in the infrastructure. So if you start a successful startup, odds are you'll start one of those. Another way to say that is, if you try to start the kind of startup that has to be a big consumer brand, the odds against succeeding are steeper. The best odds are in niche markets. Since startups make money by offering people something better than they had before, the best opportunities are where things suck most. And it would be hard to find a place where things suck more than in corporate IT departments. You would not believe the amount of money companies spend on software, and the crap they get in return.

VCs form a pyramid. At the top are famous ones like Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins, but beneath those are a huge number you've never heard of.

EET is the label for the program which attempts to analyze the development of human knowledge and epistemological norms by appealing to relevant biological considerations. Some of these attempts involve analyzing the growth of human knowledge in terms of selectionist models and metaphors (e.g., Popper 1972, Toulmin 1972, Hull 1988; see Renzi and Napolitano 2011 for a critique of these efforts).

A correlate of the above observation is that the “returns” of an evolutionary process (e.g., the speed, cost-effectiveness, or overall “power” of a process) increase exponentially over time. In another positive feedback loop, as a particular evolutionary process (e.g., computation) becomes more effective (e.g., cost effective), greater resources are deployed toward the further progress of that process. This results in a second level of exponential growth (i.e., the rate of exponential growth itself grows exponentially).

A specific paradigm (a method or approach to solving a problem, e.g., shrinking transistors on an integrated circuit as an approach to making more powerful computers) provides exponential growth until the method exhausts its potential.

To give some idea of what it could mean for a concept to be metaphorical and for such a concept to structure an everyday activity, let us start with the concept ARGUMENT and the conceptual metaphor ARGUMENT IS WAR. This metaphor is reflected in our everyday language by a wide variety of expressions: ARGUMENT IS WAR Your claims are indefensible. He attacked every weak point in my argument. His criticisms were right on target. I demolished his argument. I’ve never won an argument with him. You disagree? Okay, shoot! If you use that strategy, he’ll wipe you out. He shot down all of my arguments. It is important to see that we don’t just talk about arguments in terms of war. We can actually win or lose arguments. We see the person we are arguing

The essence of metaphor is understanding and experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another. It is not that arguments are a subspecies of war. Arguments and wars are different kinds of things—verbal discourse and armed conflict—and the actions performed are different kinds of actions. But ARGUMENT is partially structured, understood, performed, and talked about in terms of WAR. The concept is metaphorically structured, the activity is metaphorically structured, and, consequently, the language is metaphorically structured. Moreover, this is the ordinary way

The metaphor is not merely in the words we use—it is in our very concept of an argument. The language of argument is not poetic, fanciful, or rhetorical; it is literal. We talk about arguments that way because we conceive of them that way—and we act according to the way we conceive of things.

goals. Because of the way that the concept of work has developed in modern Western culture, where work is typically associated with the time it takes and time is precisely quantified, it has become customary to pay people by the hour, week, or year. In our culture TIME IS MONEY in many ways: telephone message units, hourly wages, hotel room rates, yearly budgets, interest on loans, and paying your debt to society by “serving time.” These practices are relatively new in the history of the human race, and by no means do they exist in all cultures. They have arisen in modern industrialized societies and structure our basic everyday activities in a very profound way. Corresponding to the fact that we act as if time is a valuable commodity—a limited resource, even money—we conceive of time that way. Thus we understand and experience time as the kind of thing that can be spent, wasted, budgeted, invested wisely or poorly, saved, or squandered.

This isn’t a necessary way for human beings to conceptualize time; it is tied to our culture. There are cultures where time is none of these things. The metaphorical concepts TIME IS MONEY, TIME IS A RESOURCE, and TIME IS A VALUABLE COMMODITY form a single system based on subcategorization, since in our society money is a limited resource and limited resources are valuable commodities.

We are adopting the practice of using the most specific metaphorical concept, in this case TIME IS MONEY, to characterize the entire system. Of the expressions listed under the TIME IS MONEY metaphor, some refer specifically to money (spend, invest, budget, profitably, cost), others to limited resources (use, use up, have enough of, run out of), and still others to valuable commodities (have, give, lose, thank you for). This is an example of the way in which metaphorical entailments can characterize a coherent system of metaphorical concepts and a corresponding coherent system of metaphorical expressions for those concepts.

IDEAS (or MEANINGS) ARE OBJECTS. LINGUISTIC EXPRESSIONS ARE CONTAINERS. COMMUNICATION IS SENDING. The speaker puts ideas (objects) into words (containers) and sends them (along a conduit) to a hearer who takes the idea/objects out of the word/containers. Reddy documents this with more than a hundred types of expressions in English, which he estimates account for at least 70 percent of the expressions we use for talking about language. Here are some examples:

We will call these orientational metaphors, since most of them have to do with spatial orientation: up-down, in-out, front-back, on-off, deep-shallow, central-peripheral. These spatial orientations arise from the fact that we have bodies of the sort we have and that they function as they do in our physical environment. Orientational metaphors give a concept a spatial orientation; for example, HAPPY IS UP. The fact that the concept HAPPY is oriented UP leads to English expressions like “I’m feeling up today.” Such metaphorical orientations are not arbitrary. They have a basis in our physical and cultural experience. Though the polar oppositions up-down, in-out, etc., are physical in nature, the orientational metaphors based on them can vary from culture to culture. For example, in some cultures the future is in front of us, whereas in others it is in back. We will be looking at up-down spatialization metaphors, which

HAPPY IS UP; SAD IS DOWN I’m feeling up. That boosted my spirits. My spirits rose. You’re in high spirits. Thinking about her always gives me a lift. I’m feeling down. I’m depressed. He’s really low these days. I fell into a depression. My spirits sank. Physical basis: Drooping posture typically goes along with sadness and depression, erect posture with a positive emotional state. CONSCIOUS IS UP; UNCONSCIOUS IS DOWN Get up. Wake up. I’m up already. He rises early in the morning. He fell asleep. He dropped off to sleep. He’s under hypnosis. He sank into a coma. Physical basis: Humans and most other mammals sleep lying down and stand up when they awaken. HEALTH AND LIFE ARE UP; SICKNESS AND DEATH ARE DOWN He’s at the peak of health. Lazarus rose from the dead. He’s in top shape. As to his health, he’s way up there. He fell ill. He’s sinking fast. He came down with the flu. His health is declining. He dropped dead. Physical basis: Serious illness forces us to lie down physically. When you’re dead, you are physically down. HAVING CONTROL OR FORCE IS UP; BEING SUBJECT TO CONTROL OR FORCE IS DOWN I have control over her. I am on top of the situation. He’s in a superior position. He’s at the height of his power. He’s in the high command. He’s in the upper echelon. His power rose. He ranks above me in strength. He is under my control. He fell from power. His power is on the decline. He is my social inferior. He is low man on the totem pole. Physical basis: Physical size typically correlates with physical strength, and the victor in a fight is typically on top. MORE IS UP; LESS IS DOWN The number of books printed each year keeps going up. His draft number is high. My income rose last year. The amount of artistic activity in this state has gone down in the past year. The number of errors he made is incredibly low. His income fell last year. He is underage. If you’re too hot, turn the heat down. Physical basis: If you add more of a substance or of physical objects to a container or pile, the level goes up. FORESEEABLE FUTURE EVENTS ARE UP (and AHEAD) All up coming events are listed in the paper. What’s coming up this week? I’m afraid of what’s up ahead of us. What’s up? Physical basis: Normally our eyes look in the direction in which we typically move (ahead, forward). As an object approaches a person (or the person approaches the object), the object appears larger. Since the ground is perceived as being fixed, the top of the object appears to be moving upward in the person’s field of vision. HIGH STATUS IS UP; LOW STATUS IS DOWN He has a lofty position. She’ll rise to the top. He’s at the peak of his career. He’s climbing the ladder. He has little upward mobility. He’s at the bottom of the social hierarchy. She fell in status. Social and physical basis: Status is correlated with (social) power and (physical) power is UP. GOOD IS UP; BAD IS DOWN Things are looking up. We hit a peak last year, but it’s been downhill ever since. Things are at an all-time low. He does high-quality work. Physical basis for personal well-being: Happiness, health, life, and control—the things that principally characterize what is good for a person—are all UP. VIRTUE IS UP; DEPRAVITY IS DOWN He is high-minded. She has high standards. She is upright. She is an upstanding citizen. That was a low trick. Don’t be underhanded. I wouldn’t stoop to that. That would be beneath me. He fell into the abyss of depravity. That was a low-down thing to do. Physical and social basis: GOOD IS UP for a person (physical basis), together with a metaphor that we will discuss below, SOCIETY IS A PERSON (in the version where you are not identifying with your society). To be virtuous is to act in accordance with the standards set by the society/person to maintain its well-being. VIRTUE IS UP because virtuous actions correlate with social well-being from the society/person’s point of view. Since socially based metaphors are part of the culture, it’s the society/person’s point of view that counts. RATIONAL IS UP; EMOTIONAL IS DOWN The discussion fell to the emotional level, but I raised it back up to the rational plane. We put our feelings aside and had a high-level intellectual discussion of the matter. He couldn’t rise above his emotions. Physical and cultural basis: In our culture people view themselves as being in control over animals, plants, and their physical environment, and it is their unique ability to reason that places human beings above other animals and gives them this control. CONTROL IS UP thus provides a basis for MAN IS UP and therefore for RATIONAL IS UP.

We conceptualize our visual field as a container and conceptualize what we see as being inside it. Even the term “visual field” suggests this. The metaphor is a natural one that emerges from the fact that, when you look at some territory (land, floor space, etc.), your field of vision defines a boundary of the territory, namely, the part that you can see. Given that a bounded physical space is a CONTAINER and that our field of vision correlates with that bounded physical space, the metaphorical concept VISUAL FIELDS ARE CONTAINERS emerges naturally.

out different aspects of a person or ways of looking at a person. What they all have in common is that they are extensions of ontological metaphors and that they allow us to make sense of phenomena in the world in human terms—terms that we can understand on the basis of our own motivations, goals, actions, and characteristics. Viewing something as abstract as inflation in human terms has an explanatory power of the only sort that makes sense to most people. When we are suffering substantial economic losses due to complex economic and political factors that no one really understands, the INFLATION IS AN ADVERSARY metaphor at least gives us a coherent account of why we’re suffering these losses.

Using nanobots as brain extenders is a significant improvement over the idea of surgically installed neural implants, which are beginning to be used today (e.g., ventral posterior nucleus, subthalmic nucleus, and ventral lateral thalamus neural implants to counteract Parkinson’s Disease and tremors from other neurological disorders, cochlear implants, and others.) Nanobots will be introduced without surgery, essentially just by injecting or even swallowing them. They can all be directed to leave, so the process is easily reversible. They are programmable, in that they can provide virtual reality one minute, and a variety of brain extensions the next. They can change their configuration, and clearly can alter their software. Perhaps most importantly, they are massively distributed and therefore can take up billions or trillions of positions throughout the brain, whereas a surgically introduced neural implant can only be placed in one or at most a few locations.

Virtually all of the economic models taught in economics classes, used by the Federal Reserve Board to set monetary policy, by Government agencies to set economic policy, and by economic forecasters of all kinds are fundamentally flawed because they are based on the intuitive linear view of history rather than the historically based exponential view. The reason that these linear models appear to work for a while is for the same reason that most people adopt the intuitive linear view in the first place: exponential trends appear to be linear when viewed (and experienced) for a brief period of time, particularly in the early stages of an exponential trend when not much is happening. But once the “knee of the curve” is achieved and the exponential growth explodes, the linear models break down. The exponential trends underlying productivity growth are just beginning this explosive phase. The economy (viewed

Productivity (economic output per worker) has also been growing exponentially. Even these statistics are greatly understated because they do not fully reflect significant improvements in the quality and features of products and services. It is not the case that “a car is a car;” there have been significant improvements in safety, reliability, and features. There are a myriad of such examples. Pharmaceutical drugs are increasingly effective. Groceries ordered in five minutes on the web and delivered to your door are worth more than groceries on a supermarket shelf that you have to fetch yourself. Clothes custom manufactured for your unique body scan are worth more than clothes you happen to find left on a store rack. These sorts of improvements are true for most product categories, and none of them are reflected in the productivity statistics.

The 1990s have seen the most powerful deflationary forces in history. This is why we are not seeing inflation. Yes, it’s true that low unemployment, high asset values, economic growth, and other such factors are inflationary, but these factors are offset by the double exponential trends in the price-performance of all information based technologies: computation, memory, communications, biotechnology, miniaturization, and even the overall rate of technical progress. These technologies deeply affect all industries. We are also undergoing massive disintermediation in the channels of distribution through the web and other new communication technologies, as well as escalating efficiencies in operations and administration. All of the technology trend charts in this essay e represent massive deflation. There are many examples of the impact of these escalating efficiencies. BP Amoco’s cost for finding oil is now less than $1 per barrel, down from nearly $10 in 1991. Processing an internet transaction costs a bank one penny, compared to over $1 using a teller ten years ago.

None of this means that cycles of recession will disappear immediately. The economy still has some of the underlying dynamics that historically have caused cycles of recession, specifically excessive commitments such as capital intensive projects and the overstocking of inventories. However, the rapid dissemination of information, sophisticated forms of online procurement, and increasingly transparent markets in all industries have diminished the impact of this cycle. So “recessions” are likely to be shallow and short lived. The underlying long-term growth rate will continue at a double exponential rate.

There is no need for high interest rates to counter an inflation that doesn’t exist. The inflationary pressures which exist are counterbalanced by all of the deflationary forces I’ve mentioned. The current high interest rates fostered by the Federal Reserve Bank are destructive, are causing trillions of dollars of lost wealth, are regressive, hurt business and the middle class, and are completely unnecessary. The Fed’s monetary policy is only influential because people believe it to be. It has little real power. The economy today is largely backed by private capital in the form of a growing variety of equity instruments. The portion of available liquidity in the economy that the Fed actually controls is relatively insignificant. The reserves that banks and financial institutions maintain with the Federal Reserve System are less than $50 billion, which is only 0.6% of the GDP, and 0.25% of the liquidity available in stocks.

economic models used for the social security projections are entirely linear, i.e., they reflect fixed economic growth. This might be viewed as conservative planning if we were talking about projections of only a few years, but they become utterly unrealistic for the three to four decades being discussed. These projections actually assume a fixed rate of growth of 3.5% per year for the next fifty years! There are incredibly naïve assumptions that bear on both sides of the argument. On the one hand, there will be radical extensions to human longevity, while on the other hand, we will benefit from far greater economic expansion. These factors do not rule each other out, however, as the positive factors are stronger, and will ultimately dominate. Moreover, we are certain to rethink social security when we have centenarians who look and act like 30 year-olds (but who will think much faster than 30 year-olds circa the year 2000). Another implication of the law of accelerating returns is exponential growth in education and learning. Over the past 120 years, we have increased our investment in K-12 education (per student and in constant dollars) by a factor of ten. We have a one hundred fold increase in the number of college students. Automation started by amplifying the power of our muscles, and in recent times has been amplifying the power of our minds. Thus, for the past two centuries, automation has been eliminating jobs at the bottom of the skill ladder while creating new (and better paying) jobs at the top of the skill ladder.

do think that relinquishment at the right level needs to be part of our ethical response to the dangers of twenty first century technologies. One constructive example of this is the proposed ethical guideline by the Foresight Institute, founded by nanotechnology pioneer Eric Drexler, that nanotechnologists agree to relinquish the development of physical entities that can self-replicate in a natural environment. Another is a ban on self-replicating physical entities that contain their own codes for self-replication. In what nanotechnologist Ralph Merkle calls the “Broadcast Architecture,” such entities would have to obtain such codes from a centralized secure server, which would guard against undesirable replication. The Broadcast Architecture is impossible in the biological world, which represents at least one way in which nanotechnology can be made safer than biotechnology. In other ways, nanotech is potentially more dangerous because nanobots can be physically stronger than protein-based entities and more intelligent. It will eventually be possible to combine the two by having nanotechnology provide the codes within biological entities (replacing DNA), in which case biological entities can use the much safer Broadcast Architecture.

That’s the common wisdom, but I don’t agree with it. Intelligence will be more powerful than these impersonal forces. Once a planet yields a technology creating species and that species creates computation (as has happened here on Earth), it is only a matter of a few centuries before its intelligence saturates the matter and energy in its vicinity, and it begins to expand outward at the speed of light or greater. It will then overcome gravity (through exquisite and vast technology) and other cosmological forces (or, to be fully accurate, will maneuver and control these forces) and create the Universe it wants. This is the goal of the Singularity. What kind of Universe will that be? Well, just wait and see.

Other studies (Chase & Ericsson, 1981; VanLehn, 1991) have also shown that subjects actively try out different methods and refine methods in response to errors and violated expectations. The critical importance of a correct method or strategy has also been demonstrated in date calculation

Interestingly, the correlation between prior achievement and achievement on the current course was reduced and corresponded to only about 6% of the variance for the tutored subjects as compared with around 36% for students taught with conventional methods. More generally, improved instruction appears to benefit subjects with lower cognitive ability more than high-ability subjects thus lowering the earlier discussed correlation between cognitive ability and early performance seen under standard training conditions.

Thereafter individuals are expected to give their best performance in work activities and hence individuals rely on previously well-entrenched methods rather than exploring alternative methods with unknown reliability. The costs of mistakes or failures to meet deadlines are generally great, which discourages learning and acquisition of new and possibly better methods during the time of work. For example, highly experienced users of computer software applications are found to use a small set of commands, thus avoiding the learning of a larger set of more efficient commands (see Ashworth, 1992, for a review). Although work activities offer some opportunities for learning, they are far from optimal.

Deliberate practice aimed at improving strength and endurance in sports clearly shows the importance of near maximal effort during practice and the resulting fatigue. Physical activity and exercise produce no benefit unless they are sufficiently intense. Untrained adults must attain a minimum heart rate of around 140 beats per minute or 70% of their maximal heart rate for an extended time at least three times a week to see improvements (Lamb, 1984). However, elite athletes train at much higher intensities to improve their performance. Athletes train to maximize their performance in a specific event. In endurance events, such as marathon running, most of the training consists of running at the highest speed an athlete can maintain for extended periods. Improvements resulting from training appear to be more a function of intensity (as close to maximum as possible) than of the total distance covered (Maughan, 1990). In sprint events, where runners expend maximal effort for a short time, strength training is essential (P. F. Radford, 1990). Near maximal efforts with a 3-s duration produce the most efficient results for strength training (Klausen, 1990). Obviously

In a longitudinal study of visual artists, Getzels and Csikszentmihalyi (1976) found that most artists were drawn to painting because it allowed social isolation. However, aspiring painters have to promote social relations with art dealers, art critics, and buyers to gain notoriety, increase the demand for their art, and generate sufficient sales for full-time artistic activity. Failure to do so forced many of the best artists to take another job unrelated to painting. Once these artists could no longer commit sufficient time and energy to maintain and improve their performance they stopped painting completely because they could not accept performing at a lower level. This finding shows that the activity of painting as such is not inherently motivating but rather the act of producing art that satisfies the artists' subjective criteria for quality.

From the perspective of the individual, there are four principles of plenitude. The first is a new allocation of time. For decades, Americans have devoted an increasing fraction of their time and money to the market—working longer hours, filling leisure time with activities that require more income per unit of time, and buying, rather than making, more of what they consume.

Recovering one’s time also makes self-provisioning possible and reveals a liberating truth: The less one has to buy, the less one is required to earn. The downturn has accelerated what was already a robust rediscovery of doing for oneself among sustainability pioneers. Plenitude aspires to transform self-provisioning from a marginal craft movement into something economically significant. That requires raising the productivity of the hours spent in these activities. As I argue later in the book, new agricultural knowledge and the invention of small-scale smart machines make it possible to turn household provisioning into a high-productivity—and economically viable—use of time.

These ideas reverse the direction most households have taken in recent decades and contradict what modern economics preaches, which is that specialization, in one skill or one job, is efficient. Specialization may have made sense when the market was offering better returns. Even as wages stagnated, ultra-cheap consumer goods were hard to turn down. Today, in a world of ecological and economic uncertainty and distress, putting all one’s eggs in the basket of the capitalist market looks like a more dubious proposition. The third principle of plenitude is “true materialism,” an environmentally aware approach to consumption. In the United States, the speed of acquiring and discarding products accelerated dramatically before the crash. Consumers knew relatively little about where purchases came from and the ecological impacts of their production, use, and disposal. But many people do care and want to lighten the footprint of their spending.

Work hard, not in grunt work, but in chasing such opportunities and maximizing exposure to them. This makes living in big cities invaluable because you increase the odds of serendipitous encounters—you gain exposure to the envelope of serendipity. The idea of settling in a rural area on grounds that one has good communications “in the age of the Internet” tunnels out of such sources of positive uncertainty. Diplomats understand that very well: casual chance discussions at cocktail parties usually lead to big breakthroughs—not dry correspondence or telephone conversations. Go to parties!

And one day, the people came to Warren and said, "They've invented a new loom that we think will do twice as much work as our old ones." And Warren said, "Gee, I hope this doesn't work because if it does, I'm going to close the mill." And he meant it. What was he thinking? He was thinking, "It's a lousy business. We're earning substandard returns and keeping it open just to be nice to the elderly workers. But we're not going to put huge amounts of new capital into a lousy business." And he knew that the huge productivity increases that would come from a better machine introduced into the production of a commodity product would all go to the benefit of the buyers of the textiles. Nothing was going to stick to our ribs as owners. That's such an obvious concept—that there are all kinds of wonderful new inventions that give you nothing as owners except the opportunity to spend a lot more money in a business that's still going to be lousy. The money still won't come to you. All of the advantages from great improvements are going to flow through to the customers. Conversely, if

The ancient Greeks did everything outdoors. A house was less a home than a dormitory. They spent only about thirty waking minutes there every day. They spent the rest of their day in the agora, the marketplace, working out at the gymnasium or the palaistra, the wrestling grounds, or perhaps strolling along the rolling hills.

They had no money so they had to think. Renaissance art - widely hailed as the peak of human accomplishment - began as pure propaganda. Most people were illiterate, so how could the Church reach them? How could it, for instance, depict the birth of Jesus? Captions won’t work. You have to get your message across solely with visual symbols. That is, with paintings, jam-packed with symbolism. Psychologists have identified the exact year when a child’s creative-thinking skills plateau: the fourth grade. Florence’s lack of a university was a blessing. It saved the city from a scholastic straitjacket. All golden ages, contain an element of free-for-all, a chink in time when the old order has crumbled and a new one is not yet cemented.

If I knew, I wouldn’t bother doing it.’ Creative atmospheres accepte, and even celebrate, ambiguity. Creative genius involves “superfluidity and backtracking.” Superfluidity is the willingness to pursue hunches that might well turn out to be dead ends.

First, using stones to hunt requires a lot of force and a lot of dexterity. You need to hit a target that's moving away from you at high speed, and gravity is not on your side. But defense is different. Defense happens up close. It's much easier to bash a lion with a large rock when the lion is coming toward you. And bringing the rock down allows gravity to work for you rather than against you.

Funerary traditions vary widely around the world, but all have one thing in common: disposal of the body. Mechanisms include burial, entombment, mummification, burial at sea, sky burial [5], and ritual cannibalism, and even more exotic mechanisms like hanging coffins or tree burial. The common reasons given for disposal practices are all public-health-related, but intentional burial is at least 225,000 years old. Of course our ancestors wouldn't want a corpse rotting in their camp, but there's quite a leap from disposal to burial. Why not just drag the corpse away from camp and expose it to the elements?
